# System Information

## Condition Boy (ADAMANT)
The widget on your screen shows your current physical state:
- **Limb Integrity**: Shows health for each limb.
- **Helmet Status**: The helmet icon indicates if your head is protected. If the icon isn't right, a single headshot may be instant death.
- **Armor Plates**: High-tier plates (L3 and above) can stop rifle rounds like 5.56. Plates have their own health and will degrade as they take hits.

## Engineering & Schematics
- **Blueprints**: You need to craft blueprints at the **Engineering Bench**.
- **Resources**: Crafting journals and blueprints require **Overdue Books** as a primary resource.
- **Ammo Bench**: Requires specific schematics to craft different calibers.

## Loot & Calibers
- **True Damage**: Weapon damage is often tied to the caliber rather than a generic "damage" stat. 
- **Ammo Variants**: Many calibers have multiple variants (Armor Piercing, Incendiary, etc.). Check the descriptions for their effects.
- **Enemies**: Enemies use the same armor plate and caliber systems you do.

## You Are Exceptional (YAE)
- **Reworked System**: Replaces the vanilla perk/SPECIAL system with 26 Skills.
- **Tagged Skills**: Choose 3 skills for a +25 startup bonus.
- **Skills vs Perks**: Perks are unlocked by reaching specific Skill levels (e.g., 50 Medicine).
- **Backgrounds**: Choose a character background at the start for specific gear and skill bonuses.

## Combat Overhaul
- **True Damage**: Reduces generic NPC weapon damage by 90% and replaces it with logic-based caliber scaling.
- **SCOURGE**: Adds randomized, non-linear health and resistance stats to all NPCs to make encounters unpredictable.
- **Munitions**: An expanded ammo framework adding lore-friendly calibers to the Commonwealth.

## VAFs (Vault-Tec Accelerated Focus System)
- Replaces the standard VATS with a slow-motion "Bullet Time" system.
- Perks that previously affected VATS (like Critical Banker) are integrated into the VAFs system.

## Loot & Scarcity (Damn Apocalypse)
- **Damn Apocalypse**: A major overhaul that makes the wasteland truly desolate.
    - **Loot Logic**: Loot is much rarer and more logical.
    - **Broken Items**: Many items you find may be broken, requiring repair or salvage.

    - **Examine Prey**: Use `K` to examine downed animals.
