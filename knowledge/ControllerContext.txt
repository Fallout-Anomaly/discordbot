I use a PS5 controller, but it should still be useful. Also a work in progress, there's probably a couple conflicts I overlooked.

Does the modpack have all the requirements already installed or do you need to install them all?

yes

No worries, I'm working on providing more controller support next update


[1/17/2025 12:41 PM] nomad5157
Just know a lot of mods do not have controller support and requires making a input for those particular mods

Awesome, I for one love to hear that. And okay, I gotcha. Which file should I download for that controller mod or is it just personal preference?

Would this work for an xbox controller that has back buttons as well, or probably not?


[1/26/2025 7:02 PM] jqemods
I don't see why not ... if you run into issue I would use a application called ds4 windows which can get your pc to recognize your Xbox controller as a PS4 or 5 controller

I also have my hotkeys binds in game so you can match them up I have no clue on how to send MCM presets 

So until then

The name of the mcm menu is in the top left 
The corresponding bind is on the right

The mute button when is below the playstation logo will also open the backpack...still working on it. Xbox controllers yall will need to probably play around with some of the keybinds through the steam input


[1/30/2025 1:08 PM] nomad5157
It seems that the backpack mod is eating the backpack if using a controller so you'll have to use the aid item via the wheel menu

The PS5 controller is currently supported with most mods. See our PS5 layout below. Xbox controller support is coming soon! Be sure to review the controller setup guide in the readme to avoid any issues.

This is my xbox controller config with uneducated shooter and all other keybinds, that i know of, working. Only thing I may still change is the keybind for criticals in VAFS. It’s double tap B atm, only bc I haven’t experimented with VAFS or the throw grenades keybind much or at all. If throwing grenades works as I think it should, I’d keybind VAFS to regular press LB and criticals to double tap LB. If you use this configuration with uneducated shooter, set lean left and right, in uneducated shooter's mod config, to B and M respectively, and lean only while in ADS on.

[2/7/2025 1:56 PM] sniejzakof_91079
Holding E on keyboard does it


[2/7/2025 3:23 PM] axpalladin5473
Could set E to the left stick, long press. See if that works and move the T key, wait, to another command wherever you see fit


[2/7/2025 4:36 PM] sniejzakof_91079
It's okay with E for me.i don't mind using controller and keyboard

If you use , go to mod config for uneducated shooter and set lean, left and right, to B and M. Make sure Toggle Leaning and only in ADS are on. Then set the backpack button in IAA backpacks to L. Still haven't tested power armor so you'll have to hold E manually to get out i suppose. Also feel like criticals and VAFS could be in a better spot but everything else is pretty solid. All controls are regular fallout4 controls except the following; You double tap LB for VAFS focus. You can lean, while aiming, with the left and right bumpers. Select for PipBoy and hold select for flashlight. Double tap Y to dodge, hold Y for a critical in VAFS. Press B to crouch. Hold B to rest at a campfire, for the CRACKLE mod(not tested), or double tap B for backpack inventory. Double tap X to lower weapon. Hold the down directional arrow for the quick inventory wheel menu, and tap up for favorites. Hold the left and right directional arrows for your visor and night vision(not tested). Hold the left stick, while not moving, to toggle condition boy and survival stats(Immersive Hud). Hold the start button to toggle the FOV depth blurriness. Tap the right stick to change view. You can try holding right stick to exit power armor but this isn't tested yet either. Also, I had trouble setting up supply lines but was able to do it, without any issue, by disabling the controller support mod in mo2. The controls will be a little different, but you can still play on controller like this after setting it up. It's not my preference so it's mostly untested as well. Disabling it temporarily though will allow you to set up supply lines in build mode.

It’s pretty easy to change things around with this as a template so I’d encourage anyone to go into their steam controller config for fallout 4 to edit this if something isn’t to your liking and if you mess up you can just use the link again to reset


[2/9/2025 4:10 PM] thicboijuju
hey was wondering how exactly I can apply this? im a little new to this and am unsure how to apply that controller config code. if youd be able to tell me id appreciate it a lot


[2/9/2025 4:16 PM] axpalladin5473
Copy and post the URL in your web browser and it'll take you to steam controller configuration for fallout 4. Just hit apply. Have to make sure your controller is on and steam is allowing steam controller input. I just edited it though because holding LB for VAFS was a little finicky so use that new one


[2/9/2025 4:18 PM] axpalladin5473
Once youre in-game, go to gameplay settings and turn controller on and make ure controls are set to default. Then do the above mentioned mods config. Not sure if it's still like this, but you cannot activate uneducated shooter before starting a new game or you'll have issues. Activate that mod and configure it in mod config, in-game, after you start a new save


[2/9/2025 4:21 PM] axpalladin5473
You activate it in mo2 by checking the box beside it

I’m using the controller mod in the mod pack as well as the config here but I am not able to open my pip boy or turn on light. It seems like none of the buttons correlate with the picture of the ps5 controller just bellow it. Am I doing something wrong?


[3/2/2025 8:27 PM] eselobosoyyo
When I was in settings I moved the mouse to show keyboard key bindings then selected the pip boy key bind then moved the joystick to make it switch to controller keybinds and it switched to controller keybinds with the pip boy option still needing input and just used the circle option and it was input to it instantly

[4/24/2025 5:15 PM] syphoncypher
Maybe it's the list. I went in and edited the settings and it's still not bringing up my pipboy.


[4/24/2025 5:23 PM] syphoncypher
Can anyone help me out here? I've tried everything.


[4/24/2025 5:42 PM] syphoncypher
I'm using PS5 pad and none of this is working


[4/24/2025 5:46 PM] syphoncypher
There's not evena keybind for a pipboy in the game's regular settings

Sorry to wake an old thread! I can’t figure out how to turn on the flashlight. Usually holding b works but it doesn’t seem to be with this set up


[4/24/2025 6:23 PM] axpalladin5473
Hold Select. It’s the share button or what looks like two overlapping squares on the Xbox controller, I think. Opposite of the start button. I haven’t played the updated list yet tho so this setup may be outdated idk


[4/27/2025 10:08 AM] us3r1985_94860
Just about to download the update. Did you guys fix the ps4 controller issues yet or should I still use the layout suggested by AxPalladin on this thread?

Any idea when this will be sorted? Even the above layout isn’t working anymore and I can’t figure out how to map wasd to the joysticks


[4/28/2025 10:39 AM] us3r1985_94860
Idk if this is just me but even keyboard keys aren’t working, like pressing B in character creation didn’t take me to the body part, and I can’t seem to get the jump keys working which should be space


[5/10/2025 7:29 PM] dominguez132.
Heyo, I am useing a xbox wireless controller, in game I can not open the pipboy. I have turned the control mod on and off. For whatever reason even re-mapping was not working.

Turn off the controller mod


[5/13/2025 5:12 AM] dominguez132.
That was the first thing I did


[5/14/2025 1:27 PM] c0dey.
Hey, I just downloaded the modlist. I spent quite a while verifying I had the right setup, but some buttons just don't seem to work with my PS5 controller and still display as XBox in game. Looking at this feed, should I just assume it won't work correctly?


[5/14/2025 1:41 PM] c0dey.
I believe I figured it all out. Went back further through the thread.


[5/15/2025 7:10 PM] igoturhost
I'm still having issues trying to open the pipboy. Very frustrating.

Sorry for the random ping, but how did u fix the pipboy?


[5/16/2025 11:05 AM] salamnder
Hello all, I have created a Xbox Controller Config for Fallout Anomaly that includes mode shifting which allows full functionality of most of the mods. May I share the URL here? Hoping that it can be tested by the community and I am happy to make any improvements.


[5/16/2025 11:29 AM] salamnder
Sharing anyways: steam://controllerconfig/377160/3482465058.  

I use Dynamic Helmet but only removing facial clothing, in the MCM choosing both helmet and facial clothing sometimes bugs where one stays and the other gets removed. I mainly just wanted to remove the gas mask.
Make sure to set the MCM button for removing facial clothing to "P" - I just chose a random unassigned key.
I also use Uneducated Shooter(Leaning Disabled as I like vanilla peaking better) so its mainly for Gun Inertia and Dynamic height.

All other MCM keybinds I matched with the existing Fallout Anomaly MCM Config, just make sure to apply that and this should work out of the box. Here is a list of commands:

The configuration uses Fallout 4 Default controller configuration as a base, all the normal keybinds from the game are the same.

Mode Shift:
LB + A = Weapon Wheel
LB + B = Enable/Disable HUD from Immersive HUD
LB + X = Swap semi or full auto for weapon
LB + Y = Replaceable Armor Plate
LB +RB = VAFS for slowing time
LB + RT = VAFS for using criticals
LB + Dpad down = Lower/holster weapon (hit RT to raise it again)
LB + Dpad up = Dynamic Helmet(removes facial clothing like gas mask)
LB + Dpad right = Swap should camera in 3rd person
Double Click A = Dodge(Does not work in quick succession, I will see if there are timing settings that can be adjusted and look at the mod itself to see if possible)
Left Joystick + Right Joystick click = Barber/Surgery Camera(I have not tested this yet in game, the keybind matches the MCM but will be testing hopefully today to see if it works)

I will give this a try later when I get home. Have u had any issues with getting the pipboy to pull up with this control scheme. I've tried so many different control schemes and nothing lets me pull up the pipboy unless I move to mouse and keeb.


[5/16/2025 1:11 PM] salamnder
Thanks! I have not had an issue with pulling up the pip boy because this config adds on to the default controller configuration instead of changing it entirely. The pip boy should come up just by hitting “B” like normal. I hope it works for you👍

{Reactions}
❤️

[5/16/2025 1:12 PM] igoturhost
If not, I may need to reinstall the mods as I'm wondering if something got messed up when I tried using the optional PS5 controller mod.


[5/16/2025 2:41 PM] salamnder
For smoother gameplay, be sure to go to Wheeler MCM and disable the dpad down feature since its already in the config as LB + A

[5/16/2025 9:44 PM] igoturhost
still no dice. idk what else to try at this point short of deleting eveything and starting fresh


[5/16/2025 10:09 PM] salamnder
Hmm you still cant pull up your pip boy?  I had that issue too. I think I fixed it by turning off the controller setting in the main menu, go to controls for keyboard and hit default, the turn controller back on


[5/16/2025 10:10 PM] igoturhost
Hmm, I'll try that next time I log back on

Sorry to hear. If you have optional controller mod enabled for Anomaly you could try disabling it. It is not required for my config. Hope that works, let me know👍


[5/17/2025 7:49 PM] igoturhost
I'm doing a fresh install as well. I'll let u know, I appreciate all the help tho.


[6/19/2025 10:14 PM] oxenbone
Is the controller config working for anyone? a lot of the keybinds dont do what they say they do on the readme


[6/20/2025 4:35 PM] ursorenda
it is for me but I haven't done a comprehensive check yet


[6/20/2025 4:36 PM] ursorenda
had a bit of a struggle at first (pip boy didn't seem to be mapped to B/Circle) but after some sleuthing the modpage a bit I found that it needs a specific steam controller layout in order to work properly


[6/20/2025 4:36 PM] ursorenda
easy mode to accomplish this is to copy paste this url into your browser, it will prompt you to open steam, then it should bring up a controller layout page


[6/20/2025 4:36 PM] ursorenda
steam://controllerconfig/377160/2819945625


[6/20/2025 4:37 PM] ursorenda
after applying that layout everything i checked worked as intended


[6/21/2025 2:01 AM] oxenbone
this layout works for anyone that sees this in the future

{Reactions}
💯 (2)

[6/21/2025 2:49 AM] ursorenda
also for anyone who runs into the issue of steam not bringing up the layout page, after linking out of your browser it should:
A. Open steam
and 
B. Open a subwindow inside steam with the controller layout associated with the link

If it doesn't give you the second one close steam at the system tray and reboot the steam client, then try again

Also also, per the mod author of the above controller config you should also go into the game menu after activating controller under gameplay, go into keybinds and reset to default.


[6/21/2025 4:52 AM] oxenbone
config in the pinned messages also works if you reset to default


[7/12/2025 10:12 PM] trueduck22

My controller works but how do I open my pipboy?


[8/3/2025 3:26 AM] codyfl1992
I press B and they crouch but doesn't bring up pipboy? Using a PS5 controller btw


[8/3/2025 3:26 AM] ursorenda
did yhou follow the instructions on the mod author's mod page?


[8/3/2025 3:27 AM] codyfl1992
Can you provide a link?


[8/3/2025 3:27 AM] ursorenda
go into MO2, under optionals find the PS5 support plugin, right click and select "visit on nexus"


[8/3/2025 3:30 AM] ursorenda
the instructions provided by that mod author are the only *officially* supported install instructions for using controllers with our mod pack


[8/3/2025 3:33 AM] codyfl1992
When I copy the link for the layout in my browser and enter it gives and option to open steam but steam does nothing.


[8/3/2025 3:33 AM] codyfl1992
What is the name of the layout?


[8/3/2025 3:35 AM] ursorenda
close steam, restart it


[8/3/2025 3:35 AM] ursorenda
should work


[8/3/2025 3:35 AM] ursorenda
sorry, *exit* steam, right click on it in system tray and completely close the steam app


[8/3/2025 3:36 AM] ursorenda
then restart steam lmfao


[8/3/2025 3:37 AM] codyfl1992
Okay that worked. Applied the layout. Now I go into game and reset controls to default, correct?


[8/3/2025 3:42 AM] codyfl1992
Followed the instructions and still only crouch when pressing B. No pipboy


[8/3/2025 3:56 AM] codyfl1992
I have no idea. I've read thru this thread, followed the instructions on the page you guided me to. I have no idea why something as simple as pulling up the pipboy isn't working.


[8/3/2025 3:58 AM] ursorenda
because bethesda, is the short answer.

You may attempt going to the keybind section and selecting "defaults"

But that can break things if you do it twice, so try it at your own risk


[8/3/2025 4:00 AM] ursorenda
also, as annoying of an answer as this is:

sometimes people find that reinstalling fixes that issue. We're definitely tracking that this is a bug but the majority of our users aren't controller, and we can't pin point why it does that. Best we can figure Wabba doesn't port something over correctly *some of the time*, becuase some users have zero issue (myself) and sometimes users have specific issues (your pipboy button is a common one), and other times we get weirder ones like the jump button intermittently not working lmfao


[8/3/2025 4:01 AM] ursorenda
I can tell you, one of my friends who was frustrated with the same issue reverted to a previous version and it fixed it for him. 

I've tried pitching this to others and it didn't fix it, so I'm pretty sure he just got lucky on the reinstall lol


[8/3/2025 4:02 AM] codyfl1992
What is the keyboard button for the pipboy? Maybe I can just use that to bring up but I'm guessing if the pipboy button doesn't work then other stuff won't work correctly either?


[8/3/2025 4:03 AM] ursorenda
due to the way fallout 4 was coded it's an either or situation, you can't use keyboard and controller simultaneously.


[8/3/2025 4:03 AM] ursorenda
unless I'm remembering incorrectly (again, I don't use controller)

but on keyboard it's default tab


[8/3/2025 4:05 AM] codyfl1992
Yeah tab didn't bring it up. I'll try reinstall on MO. I only play with controller so if I can't get it to work then I can't play the game which is super unfortunate lol. The modpack looks awesome


[8/3/2025 4:14 AM] codyfl1992
Even switched over to keyboard and pressing tab still doesn't bring up pipboy. It's like the pipboy is completely broken


[8/3/2025 4:30 AM] codyfl1992
It seems that the pipboy is set to I and not tab. It does let me bring it up and then navigate the pip menus with my controller. Guess I'll have to play with the controller and keyboard together but it's better than nothing I suppose lol.


[8/3/2025 4:32 AM] ursorenda
it's a bug that arises when you swap to controller without following all the instructions to the letter. 

It's annoying, and I apologize...

But I can tell you that the most reliable solution is to delete the My Documents data for FO4, do a verify integrity of game files in steam, then DM me so I can give you step by step instructions that hopefully result in a working controller setup


[8/3/2025 10:51 AM] codyfl1992
Will this require me to re-install the modpack?


[8/3/2025 2:22 PM] ursorenda
It does 😅

you can try resetting to default keybinds after swapping to keyboard and mouse


[8/15/2025 12:40 AM] quizzy317
How did you get it to work? I applied that layout but when I go in-game controls are unresponsive on the Steam Deck, only KBM work as usual. I don't have the optional controller plugin turned on.


[8/15/2025 12:41 AM] quizzy317
Fixed, need to go into the Fallout 4 settings and toggle controller on then off then on again.


[8/20/2025 10:06 AM] atombonniebaby
I'm getting this now too, and I was messing around with the settings and changed the pause menu and then all of a sudden the pip boy popped back up with the option to change it... now I can't change the pause menu button, but it was remapped anyway and still works 😅 So try remapping in the main game settings and see if you can get the pip boy to reappear there 🤷‍♀️ it never ceases to amaze me the way fo4 can break itself 😅


[9/1/2025 11:59 AM] quizzy317
So how do I get these controller config links to apply to MO2 in Steam instead of vanilla Fallout 4? When I click the links and hit apply it applies the controls to vanilla F04 and not Anomaly/MO2.


[9/6/2025 4:10 AM] ursorenda
it should apply through steam universally. It did for me, anyway


[9/24/2025 11:21 PM] gpin_
Hi is the controller supposed to work in the game main starting menu? I've followed all the instructions but it isn't working or when choosing the character starting stats?


[9/24/2025 11:58 PM] ursorenda
if f you followed the instructions on the mod page for the controller patch, yes it should work just fine


[9/25/2025 12:49 AM] gpin_
Hi, I followed the guide on the anomaly wabbajack and made sure to follow the controller section. I was using the dualsense wireless, could that make a difference?


[9/25/2025 2:51 AM] selura
So, just to be sure, an x-box elite 2 controller won't work, right?


[9/25/2025 10:14 AM] quizzy317
Works fine for me using that preset.


[9/25/2025 1:04 PM] selura
Strange, I did everything using that preset and the only thing that worked was R1 being the Activation button. Nothing else. Using the default preset that I use in vanilla Fallout and Skyrim, nothing worked.


[9/25/2025 1:07 PM] selura
Any troubleshooting I could do?


[9/25/2025 1:12 PM] gpin_
Same on duelsense controller


[9/25/2025 1:15 PM] selura
You mean that it didnt work for you, too?


[9/25/2025 1:20 PM] gpin_
Yeah duelsense controller doesn't work appart from the r1 button works and in the character creation screen clicking the left thumbstick alters the background depth of field . I've also tried using the dsx app to emulate xbox controller and ps4 controller but no joy


[9/25/2025 1:25 PM] selura
Makes sense, the description of the mod in the modorganizer says its for ps5 support, and that xbox is coming later. That's why I want to know how @Quizzy718 got it to work


[9/25/2025 1:28 PM] gpin_
Doesn't work for ps5 either, for me at least


[9/25/2025 2:58 PM] gpin_
I enabled controller in game settings and now have partial controls working


[9/25/2025 9:47 PM] ursorenda
there is no functional difference that I'm aware of between 1st party, mainstream controllers. Can't help you if you have a madcatz controller but PS and Xbox controllers work just fine for most people. 

Unfortunately we have no worldly idea why some folks get it working and some don't, we would require invasive surveying to get to the bottom of the issue and it's just not important enough for us to take such a dramatic step. 

I *can* say, I've followed the instructions to the letter about 15 times across 6 machines and had no issues. Keep trying, I'm certain you'll get it working


[9/26/2025 12:04 AM] selura
Can you paste the instructions here, step by step and in order? I feel the instructions are scattered over a handful of places.


[9/26/2025 2:12 AM] selura
Ok, nowhere was stated that we must activate the controller on the settings. It seems trivial and obvious, but it's not. I recommend updating the manual to reflect this. It worked after I activated controller mode on settings, saved and restarted.


[9/26/2025 2:25 AM] selura
How do I open pipboy? B only changes camera.


[9/26/2025 6:32 PM] gpin_
I followed all the instructions. And managed to get the ps5 controller working fully appart from the pip boy. I've noticed in the layout scheme the corresponding action for pipboy is bound to tab on the keyboard but pipboy is actually the  I key on my keyboard.
Also something strange happened, after that one and only time of getting the controller to work, once I opened the vault door using the overseer terminal and killed the tall zombie the camera freaked out  and I couldn't go into first person. Then my whole pc screen glitched out and started scrolling across right to left even after closing the game down to desktop the only thing that resolved was a restart. Now the 3rd person camera is bugged and the half the controller function have stopped even a after re installation of the list multiple times the issues have crossed over!

[9/26/2025 8:39 PM] selura
Same about the pip-boy, and it seems the CM's here are clueless. On my keyboard the pip-boy is bound to i and i can't find where to change that inside the game or in the config files.


[9/26/2025 9:46 PM] gpin_
The list is still in beta so hopefully they'll be able to fix these issues out sooner rather than later.
In the meantime I'll give  life in the ruins with radfall add on a go and I'll come back to anomaly once they've sorted the controller issues out


[9/26/2025 10:57 PM] nomad5157
We are looking into updating our controller support here in the next coming updates. It's on our list of things to do.

try this steam controller profile instead for me, if you could:

steam://controllerconfig/377160/3482465058


[9/27/2025 6:58 PM] gpin_
I reinstalled and seems like there was an update and the pip boy is now working on controller. However the controller profile that was linked in the readme doesn't work properly for me, the run button doesn't work for example


[9/27/2025 6:59 PM] ursorenda
that's likely an outdated version


[9/27/2025 7:04 PM] gpin_
Is the link you just posted called fallout anomaly xbox configuration?


[9/27/2025 7:06 PM] ursorenda
It will work for either, it was created by a user a while ago and it worked for a buddy of mine


[9/27/2025 7:23 PM] gpin_
Thanks so much!
Seems to work so far. Is there a way to add the  leaning from uneducated shooter?


[9/27/2025 7:24 PM] ursorenda
You’d have to play around with that steamcontroller profile


[9/27/2025 7:25 PM] gpin_
BTW I'm using ps5 controller and it works


[9/27/2025 7:39 PM] gpin_
@Salamnder Hi just started using your config and it's working great! I was wondering if theres a way of adding the lean to the left and right d pad when holding left trigger? I can't figure out the editing system in steam


[9/27/2025 7:58 PM] selura
No, just the same: everything works, except B button changes camera instead of openning pip-boy


[9/27/2025 8:03 PM] selura
Just to be clear, I tried changing B to press i on the keyboard, no dice.


[9/27/2025 8:04 PM] selura
I don't know if it's related, but while I'm using the controller, the keyboard presses are ignored, like the keybinds are disabled or something. This is strange all in all. Fallout 4 vanilla works very well with a controller.


[9/27/2025 8:15 PM] gpin_
I reinstalled the mod list and changed some of the controls in settings, pip boy to select and sneak to b button and I've managed to get it working


[9/27/2025 8:17 PM] selura
Settings in-game?

Yep

yes, i tried defaults already


[9/27/2025 8:26 PM] selura
something is wonky. I will purge every settings folder and file, redownload them with steam and reinstall the list

[9/27/2025 9:02 PM] selura
It didnt't work. I'm giving up


[9/27/2025 9:38 PM] gpin_
The only other thing I can think of is, I downloaded a different list and started playing it, which had the pip boy working. I then downloaded anomal and started playing and the pip boy option was there. I'm not sure if it's coincidence?


[9/27/2025 9:39 PM] selura
I finally got it to work. The solution? Disabling the Optional controller support mod.


[9/27/2025 9:39 PM] selura
Honestly I cant even fathom the need for it, since vanilla already has controller support


[9/27/2025 9:43 PM] gpin_
Nice one. Come to think of it I'm sure I disabled that mod started playing and then re enabled it.
The only thing is without the mod and controller profile you might be missing some of the controls?


[9/27/2025 9:47 PM] selura
I dont know, is there anything besides vanilla control needed? Anyway, if need be I can just edit the layout on Steam Profiles


[9/27/2025 9:49 PM] gpin_
If you keep scrolling up to @Salamnder post he's got all the controls listed like weapon wheel , dodge etc


[9/28/2025 10:34 AM] quizzy317
The linked preset doesn't need the controller mod activated. Just apply the preset, make sure the mod isn't activated, then go in-game and activate controller in the settings use KBM.


[10/3/2025 8:02 PM] blastbeats
i've given up completely. it shouldn't be this complicated


[10/4/2025 2:59 PM] ursorenda
we agree, unfortunately our efforts are focused on other systems. We aren't sure why the issue is intermittent between users.

I can tell you, there should be *significantly* less issue in the 0.6.0 update.

Just spend 5- 10 minutes on steam keybinding "steam controller" to keyboard keys.

That's what I did, I uave controller disabled on FO4

Works great.


[10/7/2025 12:26 PM] ursorenda
If I could have anyone using controller verify whether Sausage's method works for them that'd be great. That way I don't have to carve out time to test something I don't use >.<


[10/7/2025 2:54 PM] blastbeats
lol false alarm earlier


[10/7/2025 2:55 PM] blastbeats
tried your profile and salmander's but still no pipboy on B


[10/7/2025 2:55 PM] ursorenda
Did you try sausage’s method?


[10/7/2025 2:55 PM] blastbeats
nah not yet


[10/7/2025 2:55 PM] blastbeats
i don't even know any of the keyboard controls


[10/7/2025 2:56 PM] ursorenda
If I had to guess that would work the best.

@Death by sausage would you mind sharing your controller profile?


[10/7/2025 2:57 PM] blastbeats
i remember doing something very similar in oblivion years ago because it had no gamepad support on steam. it made navigating menus kinda clunky if i remember right


[10/7/2025 2:58 PM] ursorenda
You have to rethink how you nav menus, using keys rather than mouse


[10/7/2025 2:58 PM] blastbeats
oh i never use mouse anyway lol


[10/7/2025 3:00 PM] blastbeats
i've a neuropathic problem that makes keyboard and mouse impossible to use for any real stretch of time. kinda sucks because i used to be a big fps guy in the 90s


[10/7/2025 3:01 PM] blastbeats
gamepad isn't perfect but i get a lot more mileage from one


[10/7/2025 3:01 PM] ursorenda
The important keybinds are in the install guide if you wanna try sausages method


[10/7/2025 3:02 PM] blastbeats
yeah i'll give it a go later once i get some food inside of me


[10/7/2025 3:02 PM] blastbeats
i appreciate the help 🙂


[10/7/2025 7:31 PM] blastbeats
isn't the steam overlay required for steam controller input to work?


[10/7/2025 8:36 PM] ursorenda
I don't believe so


[10/7/2025 8:46 PM] blastbeats
ok i think i might have worked it out now


[10/7/2025 8:47 PM] blastbeats
how exactly are you supposed to save after the mcm settings are applied?


[10/7/2025 8:48 PM] ursorenda
we keep forgetting to add them to backgrounds

Open the ESP explorer with backslash (the key under backspace). You may have to press it a few times. Then once it's open hit R and search for cig


[10/7/2025 9:01 PM] blastbeats
amazing, that's got it working!


[10/7/2025 9:01 PM] blastbeats
thank you so much sovereign 🙂


[10/7/2025 9:07 PM] blastbeats
when i previously tried to reset the controls to the defaults they would remain the same. but when i deleted the custom control map file from the anomaly masters mod and tried it again it worked


[10/7/2025 9:07 PM] blastbeats
not sure if this is what fixed it


[10/7/2025 9:09 PM] blastbeats
i'm using salmandr's profile btw. without the controller support mod installed

Can you share this profile?


[10/8/2025 10:06 PM] selura
And a step-by-step on how you did it?


[10/8/2025 10:29 PM] blastbeats
yeah click this link in your browser and apply this preset in steam input - steam://controllerconfig/377160/3482465058
go to this path in your falloutanomaly directory - FalloutAnomaly\mods\Fallout Anomaly Master Files\F4SE - and delete CustomControlMap.txt
disable the controller support mod and load fallout anomaly. navigate the menu to enable your controller ingame then go to the customise controls screen and reset everything to default
hopefully that fixes everything for you

[10/8/2025 10:30 PM] blastbeats
this post and some of the ones below it should be read as well


[10/8/2025 10:39 PM] selura
I will give it a try and report back


[10/8/2025 10:55 PM] selura
Yesss!, it worked! Oh my god, so much suffering. Please, devs, make it simple like this from the get go.


[10/8/2025 11:45 PM] selura
Outside of the scope of this channel, but my 21:9 aspect screen, even with the mod activated, still have some elements of the UI outside the sides.


[10/9/2025 12:44 AM] blastbeats
glad i could help 🙂


[10/9/2025 7:15 AM] ursorenda
Do a server search for “high DPI” and find the instructions to disable it


[10/12/2025 9:50 PM] crotchpunchr95
how do you get the crossair to show up?


[10/13/2025 3:21 AM] blastbeats
just tried out the controller setup with the new update and it seems to work. is it normal that most of the B tap functions have been replaced by I guess, long taps? There seems to be a new type of press inbetween a tap and a long 😄


[10/13/2025 3:22 AM] blastbeats
also crouching doesn't seem to work (using an xbox controller btw)


[10/14/2025 2:45 PM] ursorenda
to be perfectly frank, we have no track on controllers atm. It's a bit of a mystery why it changes at all


[10/16/2025 3:50 PM] kingfireball0101
Is anyone playing it on a Legion Lenovo Go?


[10/29/2025 5:16 PM] supereagledrz
im unable to bring up my pipboy on controller but on keyboard and mouse i can anyone n


[10/29/2025 5:16 PM] supereagledrz
know a fix cause iv tried about everything i know


[11/1/2025 1:31 AM] stoveman_x
@Crimson-valtrax SO i restarted the launcher and set controller settings to default in the main menu before loading the game, seemed to work bringing up the pipboy.


[11/2/2025 11:45 PM] stoveman_x
also went into the documents-My Games- FO4prefs.ini folder a few times and toggled on and off bGamepadenable= 0/1 until everything ran smoothly


[11/2/2025 11:45 PM] stoveman_x
ctrl f to search in the ini's btw


[11/12/2025 4:45 PM] pyromunky8347
This seems to be the best fix for this issue


[12/3/2025 7:10 PM] genghis871412
Legend! Finally I can start playing 👍


[1/16/2026 5:34 PM] stealthavenger

[1/19/2026 8:13 PM] foxtrot8184
