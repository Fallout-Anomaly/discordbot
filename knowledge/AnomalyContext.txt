hey, so I'm running through the modpack and everything seems dandy, except for the part that I keep randomly dying. I'm not sure if radiation is what is killing me, since when I die it my geiger counter ticks. At least on my end there is no indication that I am being irradiated (used to the fo4 mechanic of your health being replaced by rads when your rad count gets higher). My rad rate is zero, I'm going through lexington and every now and then I just randomly die. I'm bored so I'm just following sally through the bus stations to see what's up since I never actually figured out what that NPC is supposed to do, and I got all the rad perks maxed out. Getting into a firefight with the robots to start the mechanist questline I can easily wipe them out, tank the explosions, I tanked a mini nuke at lexinton with the one raider in power armor, but then my screen goes white and then I die just out of nowhere


[8/1/2025 1:25 AM] yearzero
Does anyone have any idea what can be causing this?


[8/1/2025 3:56 AM] ursorenda
There are several things that could be causing that :p

My first question, are you aware of the DA/MAIM Redux system for RADs and IRAs?
No worries if not, that's something we wanna address.


[8/1/2025 6:22 AM] tiburse
I know this is prob a silly question. But do we have a wiki? I cant seem to find my vats button (Q). I do not know if it is just not in the game or locked behind a quest. Im completly new to fallout mods (not the base games) and have never played stalker so I am in the dark. 

Backstory, my friend loves the stalker series and wanted to get into FO4 (she has only played 3 and 76) . I wanted to mod FO4 for something new. So here we are.


[8/1/2025 7:00 AM] tmason18
Ever since I started the game a few days ago, vats won't activate like the key binding doesn't work. Amy known issues?


[8/1/2025 8:40 AM] tiburse
I think I may have found it under VAFS Redux


[8/1/2025 12:33 PM] maetthekid
that sums up the wipe pretty well lol


[8/1/2025 12:52 PM] uberfuzionz
armor


[8/1/2025 1:43 PM] yearzero
I’m not too familiar with it. I can’t even tell if I’m being irradiated other than the Geiger counter. At least for me there’s nothing that pops up on the status page of the pip boy, or on the hud


[8/1/2025 3:00 PM] hazelfawn
So uh... anyone else got the 'Vault 111 alarm and announcer complaining about cryogenic failure audio' playing all the time whenever you are inside a indoor cell? like, at every indoor cell?


[8/1/2025 3:25 PM] ursorenda
you have to restart the game, it goes away. Known bug we're not sure why it does that


[8/1/2025 3:25 PM] ursorenda
it defaults to the G key, if that helps


[8/1/2025 3:26 PM] hazelfawn
It's stayed around for a few days now... It's not leaving me alone no matter the number of restarts 🙁


[8/1/2025 3:26 PM] ursorenda
look on your bottom left of your screen, above your compasss, do you have a few green bars stacked over there?

Also go into your Aid inventory and find your Radboy, use it and tell me what your IRAs are


[8/1/2025 3:26 PM] ursorenda
Can you make a support ticket and drop your save for me?


[8/1/2025 3:27 PM] hazelfawn
Sure! I'll do that now


[8/1/2025 3:27 PM] ursorenda
it's being built out atm :p


[8/1/2025 3:27 PM] tiburse
Copy that, if I had more of an attention span I would offer to help.


[8/1/2025 3:29 PM] tiburse
You all do amazing work. This is the most fun I have had on Fallout in a long time. 76 kind of drained me and I couldn't see paying monthly anymore.


[8/1/2025 3:30 PM] ursorenda
yeah we totally understand, it feels lot like if you were to make WoW a shooter lmfao


[8/1/2025 3:31 PM] ursorenda
upping the stakes with global damage values really breathes life into Fallout. Like, could you imagine them adding a hardcore mode in 76?


[8/1/2025 3:52 PM] yearzero
ok so, I'm in the game, I cant post a screenshot here but my rads were at moderate, 915/1000. Under the compass all I see is an hp bar


[8/1/2025 3:52 PM] yearzero
so the issue was I was heavily irradiated 🤦‍♂️


[8/1/2025 3:53 PM] yearzero
Is there usually a bar below the compass that indicates your rad levels or do you have to go to the radboy to find out?


[8/1/2025 3:53 PM] ursorenda
above the compass, not below.

The green bars are your RADs, the IRAs are how much radiation you've consumed.

They feed into each other


[8/1/2025 3:54 PM] ursorenda
you can hotkey your Radboy to quickly check


[8/1/2025 3:54 PM] yearzero
oh yeah theres nothing there. There is a vertical bar to the left of the screen that's above the compass


[8/1/2025 3:54 PM] ursorenda
yeah


[8/1/2025 3:54 PM] ursorenda
that would be your RADs


[8/1/2025 3:55 PM] yearzero
Oh LMFAO


[8/1/2025 3:55 PM] ursorenda
:p


[8/1/2025 3:56 PM] yearzero
There was this weird robot voice telling me that my rads were moderate too but I figured it was just the environment, not my current state of being


[8/1/2025 3:56 PM] ursorenda
RADs measure how damaged your tissue is, and is responsible for the resulting conditions like Lithium Lung. 

IRAs measure how many irradiated particles are in your system, and will inflict periodic RADs. That robot voice is your Radboy telling you your IRA readout. At that level it should have been saying "Radiation levels: extreme"

Either getting too high will kill you.


[8/1/2025 3:58 PM] yearzero
I see I see


[8/1/2025 3:58 PM] yearzero
hey well thanks for your help, it's been a stable experience so far, Just gotta learn all the new features now


[8/1/2025 4:00 PM] ursorenda
We have hopes to get a user guide out soon, which we'll eventually convert to a video guide


[8/1/2025 4:00 PM] yearzero
now, is that green vertical bar supposed to turn a different color when you start getting more rads?


[8/1/2025 4:01 PM] ursorenda
nope, it's existence indicates you have RADs and grows vertically as RADs increase


[8/1/2025 4:02 PM] yearzero
heard


[8/1/2025 4:03 PM] yearzero
well thanks! appreciate your time


[8/1/2025 4:22 PM] .zathros
So in the past couple of days it seems like i've stopped gaining radiation. What could be causing this? I do have rank 1/5 of Radiation Resistant, but I didn't think it would matter that much.


[8/1/2025 4:33 PM] ursorenda
Could be armor, could be a change in the choices you make, could also be that 1/5 rank in Rad resist perks. 

I mean if you do a lil jig on top of an irradiated barrel do you still get RADs?


[8/1/2025 4:34 PM] hazelfawn
Was on my way to find a doctor for my heavily irradiated character - guess who just happens to be in concord: the traveling doctor!


[8/1/2025 4:34 PM] hazelfawn
Doc Anderson


[8/1/2025 4:34 PM] ursorenda
Nice!


[8/1/2025 4:34 PM] .zathros
No I don't gain any from any sources. IRA still increase. Just not base rads


[8/1/2025 4:35 PM] ursorenda
If you can make a support ticket and drop your save so I can check it out that would be appreciated


[8/1/2025 4:39 PM] .zathros

[8/1/2025 4:40 PM] ursorenda

[8/1/2025 5:07 PM] tiburse
Final question (for now). Is there a level cap?


[8/1/2025 5:07 PM] ursorenda
nope


[8/1/2025 5:07 PM] ursorenda
or if there is it's proposterously high up there


[8/1/2025 5:11 PM] tiburse
Thanks


[8/1/2025 5:12 PM] tiburse
Just wanted to make sure before I got to deep and needed to change traits and such


[8/1/2025 5:12 PM] ursorenda
the time it takes to level up does go up pretty high so there is *some* consideration to make but for most builds it shouldn't take too long


[8/1/2025 5:19 PM] .zathros
I fixed my radiation issue. It was an issue with Post Apocalyptic gear. I took the mask off and put it back on, now i'm slowly dying in the glowing sea while trying to get to Virgil lol

[8/2/2025 3:18 AM] yearzero
hey, so I wanted to double back on this topic. I went into the FallUI hud and I realized that I'm not seeing my rads or the counter going up because I'm on ultrawide. Key info was being clipped out of the ultrawide borders (rads, grenades, the rad counter, even the AP). Once I changed it to what i liked I can better grasp the concept on what's going on and how to mitigate it. I knew I wasn't dumb 😭

Is it possible for me to somehow re-enable them


[8/2/2025 11:53 AM] ursorenda
yes but I A. don't personally know how to, B. understand that it takes a decent amount of effort, and C. am not at liberty to provide instructions regardless.


[8/2/2025 11:54 AM] ursorenda
you can try reinstalling cheat terminal but since that just executes console commands I have no track on whether it will work. 

You may also do so at your own risk, due to the aforementioned bugs.


You can also switch from Survival to Very Hard in the game settings


[8/2/2025 11:55 AM] ursorenda
Though I warn you, the game becomes *very* easy after you do that


[8/2/2025 11:55 AM] thatoneguy78
Hmmmmm


[8/2/2025 11:55 AM] thatoneguy78
I had tried to reinstall cheat terminal to its new updated version but the only thing that did was remove my ability to jog


[8/2/2025 11:56 AM] ursorenda
hopefully you have a prior save to revert to :p


[8/2/2025 11:56 AM] thatoneguy78
This was on a fresh save on a fresh install so I just reinstalled the old version and it reverted the issue


[8/2/2025 11:58 AM] ursorenda
Bethini just applies known settings to the Fallout4.ini, Fallout4prefs.ini, and fallout4custom.ini based on what you enter into the GUI.

On the top left drop down menu, the middle one should have two item one of which is "Setup"

Click setup and point the game path to the Fallout Anomaly: Install Directory > Stock Folder > Fallout4.exe
Point the ini path to Fallout Anomaly: Install Directory > Profiles > Fallout Anomally Beta > Fallout4.ini


[8/2/2025 11:59 AM] ursorenda
please be aware we have not fully tested Bethini past adjusting the resolution. 

We use shadowboost so I'm pretty sure a lot of those settings are adjusted dynamically, anyway. 

But yeah use at your own risk :p


[8/2/2025 12:00 PM] ursorenda
Yeah you're basically backing up your saves. Install Directory > Profiles > Fallout Anomaly > Saves

When you update you want to delete *the entire install directory folder*

Not your downloads folder, keep that. But the install can't be overwritten without risking bugs out of Wabbajack.

is there not a mod i can turn off its hella annoying


[8/3/2025 2:30 PM] ursorenda
No, turning off DA would break things. 

You can adjust the settings in the mcm if you’d like


[8/3/2025 2:30 PM] ursorenda
Damn Apocalypse is the mod


[8/3/2025 2:30 PM] samanthax_x

So with a ratio of people to food being 7:42 why is it that no food enters the workshop storage?

Also is there a way to scrap the buildings in Sanctuary rather than repair them?


[8/3/2025 5:28 PM] tiburse
I feel like there is a setting I am missing

it should work, just load it last. It won't cover the bobbleheads we added :p

[8/3/2025 11:21 PM] ursorenda
they're only buildable at weaponsmith benches, you have to either build the engineering workbench and unlock all of the recipes or adjust the MCM settings menue for it

Does the difficulty need to be set to survival or can you change it to a lower one and still play the modpack as intended?


[8/4/2025 1:12 PM] samanthax_x
anyone know how to install pip boy 2000 on this modpack without it crashing


[8/4/2025 1:16 PM] reversalshadow7540
Its recommend to play survival. But i just played on very hard


[8/4/2025 1:17 PM] reversalshadow7540
I couldn't be bothered to loose tons of progress because I didnt sleep in a bed and my game crashed. Crashes werent often but still in a modded game playing for a hours at time somtimes a crash if bound to happen


[8/4/2025 1:49 PM] ursorenda
that would take loooooads of work


[8/4/2025 1:49 PM] ursorenda
You can save at chairs lol


[8/4/2025 1:54 PM] samanthax_x
PLEASSSSSSEEEEEEE


[8/4/2025 1:54 PM] reversalshadow7540
Ill stick with very hard and quicksave plus I ain't got time to manage water and stats outside of rads I just like the combat difficulty and the core of the pack and just added a bunch of settlement mods into mine. I havint played in awhile tho I been hooked on cyberpunk rn


[8/4/2025 1:55 PM] ursorenda
We may open a discussion to the community about changing the pipboy at a later time but for now, no


[8/4/2025 1:56 PM] ursorenda
Just remember, we can’t help you if things start to break! 

Mostly because settlement mods add a lot of save bloat


[8/4/2025 2:03 PM] reversalshadow7540
Yeah be my own fault lol. But luckily they pack ran very smooth for me when I was playing. Maybe the save bloat was they reason for they only issue i ever had was when dieing and respawing like all the enemies in the building that killed my are just gone after reload lol. So I just would close the game to desktop reboot and all was good again. So I was happy enough lmao  Early game was kinda a pain dying alot but by late game i never died


[8/4/2025 2:10 PM] nomad5157

[8/4/2025 4:00 PM] mycroft_holmes77
quick question: I'm having some LOD troubles. It seems to not want to load objects in world when i travel, o eventually i'll come to an area with bare ground and the game will pause and load for a few minutes. I've already expanded my pagefile to 16gb, is there something else i should do?


[8/4/2025 4:01 PM] heichou
Dude I cannot believe the abandoned tunnels mod doesn't have a map on its mod page


[8/4/2025 4:01 PM] heichou
The only reference I have is one 6 year old YouTube video


[8/4/2025 4:01 PM] heichou
Kill me


[8/4/2025 4:02 PM] ursorenda
yeah it can get annoying. 

If it makes it past the cutting room floor and flagged for extended inclusion I'll end up integrating the locations into the User Guide


[8/4/2025 4:03 PM] heichou
Like I absolutely love the mod; it's been indispensable. But it's killing me that I've been in Natick looking for this manhole for 10 minutes now and I can't even see the icon on the compass


[8/4/2025 4:03 PM] ursorenda
I'll ask you to make a support ticket about that here https://discord.com/channels/1113971680419782666/1315750844964016238

Also your Pagefile should be 1.5x your ram size, or at least 16gb. 

I rock 40gb.


[8/4/2025 4:03 PM] heichou
Fuck it; taking cartographer perk


[8/4/2025 4:03 PM] ursorenda
You could play around with FallUI in the MCM and try making your compass bigger?


[8/4/2025 4:04 PM] mycroft_holmes77
Ah I'll expand it then


[8/4/2025 4:04 PM] heichou
I mean the issue is just that it isn't there. I see other icons, but no icon for the manhole


[8/4/2025 4:04 PM] heichou
Unless it's been placed an asinine distance away

[8/4/2025 7:12 PM] ursorenda
The left hand icons are for helmet and ballistic plates. 

The helmet icon simply indicates whether or not a head shot will kill you instantly, and the armor plates are a tad buggy but the color gradient should indicate it's health


[8/4/2025 7:27 PM] tiburse
Slight issue, I seem to have hit a point where I am no longer allowed to save anywhere.


[8/4/2025 7:28 PM] tiburse
I am in sanctuary, hidden. Tried making new chairs, couches, ect. Everything I am able to craft and nothing has the ability to save. Nor can I save in menu.


[8/4/2025 7:29 PM] tiburse
I have now lost the ability to use any seat.

[8/4/2025 7:41 PM] tiburse
Ah so if normal saving is broken craft a survival pack to save. Got it, thank you. I just made 5 of them for backup. Normally its save at any chair I come to to not have to worry haha.


[8/4/2025 7:41 PM] nomad5157
Yes, they can be used like quick saves. Next update the entire save process will be reworked for the better

[8/4/2025 8:36 PM] ursorenda
adjust the damage values under True Damage. 

What caliber is your tommygun usin?


[8/4/2025 8:37 PM] codyfl1992
I'd have to look. Not sure.


[8/4/2025 8:39 PM] ursorenda
take a look next time you're usin it. 

Use this chart to kinda common sense whether it should be doin more damage. 

Also remember that until limb health is zero'd shots to the arms and legs don't do hp damage

I'm gonna assume it's weak ammo. Probably like 9mm or something


[8/4/2025 8:41 PM] ursorenda
yeah 9/10mm doesn't do nearly the damage people are used to in vanilla FO, so that throws a lot of people off.

I noticed that, took some getting used to. Side note, Ive been having issues with dogmeat just poofing and not coming back. Having to return to the RR just to have him follow again.


[8/4/2025 8:43 PM] ursorenda
is he gettin downed and you aren't reviving him? If you don't heal companions and you just head out without em they TP back to their original locations


[8/4/2025 8:44 PM] tiburse
Not that I have noticed. I even turned off follower damage taken just to test that.


[8/4/2025 8:44 PM] tiburse
Still, he poofs. Only running him as follower. Have not tried with any others at this time.


[8/4/2025 8:45 PM] tiburse
Like, I went to RR got him took the tunnels to Diamond City he didnt follow. Went back got him again. Took the APC this time. Still nothing.


[8/4/2025 8:45 PM] ursorenda
I know that AFT can cause some similar jenk but not to the extend that you would have to go grab em from their spawn location. 

I would say go into the AFT Master Control holotape and change Dogmeats Combat AI to stay closer to you and see if that helps


[8/4/2025 8:45 PM] ursorenda
lemme run some testing to see if that's replicatable


[8/4/2025 8:46 PM] tiburse

[8/4/2025 9:23 PM] mycroft_holmes77
i havent found one so far


[8/4/2025 9:25 PM] ursorenda
.357 is always going to be a revolver, the actual name of the gun escapes me.

.40 I believe is an option for the tommy gun. If I get my way we’re gonna be purging a lot of the more exclusive calibers


[8/4/2025 9:42 PM] killerqueen4
Tommy gun irl is a .45 caliber submachine gun, its been a second since I played anomaly but it should still be a .45


[8/4/2025 9:42 PM] killerqueen4
.40 s&w is a weird caliber


[8/4/2025 9:43 PM] killerqueen4
It was developed to be a combination between 9mm and .45 acp


[8/4/2025 9:43 PM] killerqueen4
Which kind of failed, but is still popular in niche communities for being a weird caliber


[8/4/2025 10:01 PM] tiburse
Could be worse. Could be a .32


[8/4/2025 10:02 PM] tiburse
I have one and ya girl cant fucking find ammo for it without driving 2 hours into BFE.

[8/4/2025 10:06 PM] ursorenda

It should be one of the options when building. I'll have to get back to you and look more into it


[8/5/2025 3:51 PM] nomad5157
It was removed several versions ago because it is far too script heavy for a modlist this size


[8/5/2025 3:51 PM] tiburse
Thanks fam I tried going through them and couldn't find it. Grant you I'm almost blind so that doesn't mean much lol

[8/5/2025 4:57 PM] heichou
To tell you the truth, I don't really feel like flooding the support channel with multiple separate posts every time I find something to gripe about. I just don't feel that it's worth the effort


[8/5/2025 4:59 PM] nomad5157
We rather you do. It may not be a issue in itself but it's something we could possibly improve on

That being said, Anyone on the team have an update about the update, i desire wasteland pain


[8/5/2025 5:55 PM] ursorenda
The actual release date, no we don’t have an update. But there’s plenty to look forward to! We’re adding loads of weapons and armors, faction overhauls, and balances checks to go along with them all.

We’re also building a launcher to hopefully prevent a lot if the issues users are getting on installation

It's from the launcher we are building


[8/5/2025 7:41 PM] ursorenda
currently that's done in the .ini in MO2 or through bethini

[8/6/2025 4:35 AM] de.la.murk
yeah


[8/6/2025 4:36 AM] ursorenda
we have absolutely zero support for the companion app. 

In more specific terms, we have not tested it's compatibility at all. It's very much a use it at your own risk type deal


[8/6/2025 4:37 AM] de.la.murk
i see, it default to view only all the time, every other function seesm to work properly, i mainly use it for a "minimap" so to speak, appreciate you fr


[8/6/2025 4:40 AM] ursorenda

is there a way i can turn the trees and fauna a bit down so i dont get 30fps


[8/6/2025 1:34 PM] ursorenda
That just makes power armor easier to use. 

You need to find someone who can train you to use power armor


[8/6/2025 1:35 PM] ursorenda
I just play cuz it took the place of online shooters in my repertoire of addictions lol


[8/6/2025 1:37 PM] ursorenda
IIRC only if it modifies its own parent


[8/6/2025 1:38 PM] ursorenda
Best would be to use Bethini to lower the base settings, modifying the trees and fauna would take a lot of work


[8/6/2025 1:38 PM] samanthax_x
bethini what is that?


[8/6/2025 1:44 PM] ursorenda
where you installed FOA, you'll find the Tools folder
open that, open Bethinipie, then launch the Bethini.exe, making sure MO2 is closed before you do 
once there, nave to the Setup and make the correct paths (it defaults to a virtual drive that wont exist on your pc)\

[8/6/2025 1:45 PM] ursorenda
this is the pathing that's default setup, it basically just needs to be changed to the correct drive folder. 


For the Game Path, you'll nav to the FOA Install Directory > Stock Folder > Fallout4.exe

For the ini path, you'll nav to the FOA Install Directory > Profiles > Fallout Anomaly Beta > Fallout4.ini

ive read to change the ini to read only but i have no idea how to change it to that


[8/6/2025 3:21 PM] ursorenda
you would right click on the ini and select properties


[8/6/2025 3:21 PM] ursorenda
read only is a checkbox at the bottom

Speaking to the message above.

Resolution is changed with bethini pie. The ini files that actually take effects are the ones located in the profiles folder not the documents folder

There are major changes in the works being done to bring the next version of anomaly the best it has ever been and this will take a considerable amount of time but worth the wait I promise


[8/6/2025 6:59 PM] waliidation
would you recommend waiting for the update to be out before installing or will my save be transferable? I'm fine waiting it's just I don't have nexus premium so installing is gonna take a while


[8/6/2025 7:04 PM] drakodraconis
I'm gonna say probably worth installing now I have a feeling the update is gonna take long enough

[8/6/2025 8:00 PM] 911reg
(sorry for the ping on an old comment)
do you have any idea why it could be that VRAMr isn't finding the BA2 files from the game's stock folder? i'm runnin it through MO2 as i've normally done in a few skyrim modlists, but sadly it doesn't seem to be working, and i don't know if it's related to the modlist itself?

I’ve been looking all over and I’m not seeing much on the infin rads situation? From my understanding the yellow stim that removes IRA’s is also meant to decrease rads right?


[8/7/2025 1:06 AM] ursorenda
nope


[8/7/2025 1:08 AM] ursorenda
Infinite RADs were patched in 0.5.7.4

Ca-DTPA will reduce IRAs
Mutaway will reduce RADs

IRAs can be checked with the Radboy item in the aid category (reusable)
RADs can be checked with the guage on the bottom left, above your compass (Green Bars, any more than 2 is bad news)

Doctors can remove your RADs, as well. 

RADs will become near constant if your have high IRAs

I appreciate you asking, if you could include a screenshot of the map location so i can investigate on my own save that'd be clutch. 

Or drop your save in the ticket, that also works.

Most attributes now have a perk associated with them, in the case of the Local Leader perk it's Influence at 15 and 30 points for ranks 1 and 2


[8/7/2025 3:48 PM] ursorenda
if you're talking about this mod https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/87318 there's like a million different reasons it wouldn't work, all of which have to do with custom patches created to make everything play nice. 

You will not (likely) be able to make anything even approaching the descriptor "overhaul" work with our modpack without a lot of custom patches.

But you can certainly drop it in the suggestions!

[8/7/2025 6:46 PM] booyoo
Gotcha! So would antibiotics cure lithium lung or is it all rads based?


[8/7/2025 6:48 PM] ursorenda
we really need to adjust the tooltip of Ca-DTPA, the illness and state of radiation poisoning is RAD dependent. 

A high level of IRAs will cause a status effect called Periodic Rads which will occasionally apply a timed session of +5 RADs (which is insanely high and will kill you very quickly)

Your Radboy is infinitely reusable, you should hotkey it

{Reactions}

[8/7/2025 6:48 PM] ursorenda
stay on top of your IRAs (which is shown by using the Radboy)


[8/7/2025 6:49 PM] ursorenda
in your case, your two options are to find a doctor or level medicine to 50 so you can craft your own Mutaway

So I used mutaway, and my green bars went away and my health regened back. But I still have the debuffs

now try Ca-DTPA. just to make your life easier and because it's for testing purposes use player.additem 00023742

[8/8/2025 10:36 AM] tomtombar
Just a small question, is it intentional that the enemies always instant spot you? I mean shit man Im 200 yards away from a bandit in concord, and as soon as I lean around a corner slowly, the moment I get LOS on them they turn around and start shooting at me.


[8/8/2025 10:50 AM] tomtombar

[8/8/2025 1:32 PM] tomtombar
ok yeah i wouldnt think it would be, i mean the atmosphere of the modpack with a scarce weapon system, relying mostly on melee weapons but using guns for scarier encounters and people that have guns seems a lot of fun, hopefully the config option works

[8/8/2025 2:06 PM] ursorenda
Not specific for steam deck, no. 

But it should be as easy as installing through wabba and using the optional mod for controller support. Dont forget to grab the controller profile off its mod page

OK I'll give it a try. Do you know if the controller support mod will conflict with the Steam controller input or F4's controller support itself?

I am getting a download failed, 2 archives missing. Looks like "enbseries_fallout4_v0501.zip" and "Fallout Anomaly HUDS.zip".


[8/8/2025 5:17 PM] quizzy317
Sorry for the spam, just found the readme and it addresses the issues above. Only problem is I click Show Missing Archives and nothing happens so I can't get the link for the HUDS.

So I checked one of my saves, I have a worse ratio of people to food prod and I'm getting food and water into my workshop inventory, granted I'm like 10 hours into that save and I setup sanctuary in the first hour


[8/8/2025 7:44 PM] ursorenda

How long has it been since you got things up and running?


[8/8/2025 7:50 PM] tiburse
The food has been a while, the water about 4 in game days or 3 hours played


[8/8/2025 7:52 PM] ursorenda
interesting. Go into the Workshop Framework MCM menu, under settlement options turn on "consume basic items" and see if that does anything for you

Seek out any faction that uses PA as a mainstay. Your relationship to that faction and what kind of people they are determine what the cost to be taught PA training is 🙂

Which mod handles conversations. As people always walk away when im in the trading menu or talking to them.


[8/8/2025 9:08 PM] monetaryfx
No worries found it i think. Fallsouls.


[8/8/2025 9:10 PM] ursorenda
there isn't one specific mod that handles that, it's a known bug that's engine level, we have on our list of things to fix. Sadly, it's very low on the list. 

In the interim you should be able to use Setrestrained 1 after selecting the npc in question. Setrestrained 0 to let them free (don't forget, you'll get issues down the line)

Note that it is a specific NPC (with an AI voice, might I begrudgingly add) that will offer to train you. You'll find holotapes that give you little upgrades for when you *do* get power armor training, but they're useless til then

why is power armor weak for the player, but a tank for the npc


[8/9/2025 3:25 AM] ursorenda
That sounds a lot like you’re using the wrong caliber weapons to fight PA


[8/9/2025 3:26 AM] ursorenda
Last time I ran PA I cleared the entire subway system and only lost an arm off my PA.

Inversely as long as Im using 5.56 or higher is a matter of making sure I target the PA enemy first and aim for the head. Never takes more than a few shots as long as i open with a sneak attack

quick question, when I try to manage a settlement and go to layouts it says "no settlement layouts found installed" and it does it for every single one I tried is it normal?


[8/9/2025 4:47 PM] ursorenda
You have to install settlement layouts.

Does this modlist use any camping mods? Wouldn’t feel like a true survival experience without them


[8/9/2025 5:52 PM] 56tr
well you can use surviuval kit to "make camp and save game", but its just a quicksave, theres also companion option to "set up camp" thats doesnt work for me, and you can find vanilia camps in wilderness to "camp"


[8/9/2025 6:21 PM] tomtombar
So I did finally get that working, the NPC's using ammo, this mod + its requirements which is 2 weapon fix mods, enables the usage of NPC ammo, completely making ammo much rarer and more scarce, incentivizing you to spec into melee to somewhat conserve your ammo for heavier encounters. 

 I think that makes combat just so much more fun

Im cooking up something quite cool. I made a whole cod ghost inspired voice over for fallout 4s main characters dialogue. ( took me bloody ages ) but the final product was a little janky. 11labs didnt exactly capture the tonality and per line emotional aspect. Im thinking about recording my own dialogue lines ( im a londoner so would be british london accent inspired ) and was thinking about using speech to speech ai tools to make some European sounding accents too. I am by no means a dev but i was wondering if anyones ever played around with dialogue in fallout 4. As tryna edit the pauses in conversation and other finiky bits may prove difficult. Ngl i want to make a sick voice line mod where you can chose amongst a few different accents a voice types. And i think for a modlist like anomaly that could be pretty cool. Im willing to front the cash for the software required. But i was wondering if any actual modders have any experience within the dialogue modding specifically 🤔

There is a mod that controls settler attack spawn rates. I forget what it is called off the top of my head, But I do know I turned them off there until I got built up.


[8/10/2025 10:38 PM] tiburse
So, in theory you could move sliders to cause attacks to be harder/happen more frequent. If it turns into a siege I do not know.

the error message is correct, this modpack runs 0.6.23. The most up to date version of F4SE is for the new gen version. ATM we don't have plans to update due to our modpack needing a downgrader.

[8/11/2025 2:33 PM] ursorenda
screenshots I'm not certain, that may just be an unfortunate case of collateral damage in patching. 

But the "mod" in question disabling quicksaves is called Survival difficulty. Vanilla FO4 is responsible for that functionality. As @56TR pointed out, you would quicksave at a chair. 

Crafting and using Survival Packs will provide a "hard save" that persists, where as the game will only retain 3 quicksaves.

This was done to combat save bloat.

I would if I had access :p

The post will be migrated there once I get one of the Overseers to do so


[8/11/2025 2:40 PM] .palker
i would like to be a beta tester but i don't think my tastes allign with the creator's vision so my feedback would be very biased


[8/11/2025 3:06 PM] .palker
actually i might be one since i'm finding so many bugs that i think someone should probably say something about it


[8/11/2025 3:22 PM] ursorenda
Beta Testing is more directed than freeform, regardless 😛


[8/11/2025 3:37 PM] perinthia
Hey, Im currently out at work so i cant tinker with it, but does anyone know how to resize the game? I use a 3440x1400 ultra wide monitor, i did update the INI but still has a bit of stuff off the side and bottom of the monitor


[8/11/2025 3:38 PM] ursorenda
are you using the provided Ultra Wide patch?


[8/11/2025 4:33 PM] heichou
Part of the install is turning off overlays iirc. So the steam overlay would be turned off, which would in turn disable screenshot functionality. Just use WIN+Shift+S instead


[8/11/2025 4:51 PM] heichou
Didn't really understand the "availability" portion too much; are there going to be like group sessions where multiple people test something out together, or was that more of a "how often do you play video games" sort of question?


[8/11/2025 5:03 PM] ursorenda
just when you'll generally be available. We understand that not everyone will be available on the same days, so we take that into account when selecting people for the Beta team. We're aiming for 10 people that can, in organized collaboration, test throughout the week. The sooner we can get feedback to the devs the faster we can fix things 🙂


[8/11/2025 5:10 PM] heichou
Gotcha. Sun/Mon/Tues are my days off so I usually have all the time in the world then, but I usually have at least an hour or so on the days I work, but I wasn't sure if that'd be useful info so I chose to be concise


[8/11/2025 5:14 PM] ursorenda
yeah any amount of contribution is helpful. Like I said, it's just to make sure we don't have a proponderance of overlap


[8/11/2025 5:14 PM] heichou
Gotcha; gotcha

We're adding a launcher in our next version that's gonna circumvent the readme entirely.

getting rid of wabbajack?


[8/11/2025 9:26 PM] ursorenda
not rid of, it will act as a sort of nexus for all of the tools we currently use, removing the need to educate users on how to set paths, nav to the correct enb versions, download the HUD file from Gdrive, along with a host of other issues we've been collecting feedback on. 

Generally speaking it'll further automate the installation and update process as much as we can without having to pay in order to get a security certificate from msoft (meaning the launcher will still direct you to take certain steps manually)

Wabba, MO2, and some of the other tools will still be accessible for those who want to customize further but it will come with a giant pop up that forces you to acknowledge: we won't be able to provide any troubleshooting support if you do so.

does anyone know where the apc holotape is? didnt spawn on me immediatly and cnat find where to craft it


[8/11/2025 9:28 PM] ursorenda
dont forget to react to the role at the bottom of the post here https://discord.com/channels/1113971680419782666/1259594801125392494 to unlock the rest of the server!

You certainly can spawn the holotape.... from the MCM menu :p. But it does nothing unique compared to the MCM menu. Pause the game with esc, select Mod Configuration, and I believe it resides under the gameplay category with the name APC Transport


[8/11/2025 9:32 PM] ursorenda
the first time you access that menu it will organize all of the mods according to a preset. This may look like it froze on you, I promise you it didn't (in like 99.999% of cases, anyway) give it some time, your pc specs affect the time it takes to process. 

It's only gonna do that the first time you install/update, after that it opens just fine. 

Don't forget to apply the MCM preset at the top, that's required if you would like us to help you out if you run into any bugs!


[8/11/2025 9:33 PM] hanglive
doesnt give the option to spawn a holotape


[8/11/2025 9:33 PM] hanglive
specifically im trying to use the auto drive function to call the apc to my location


[8/11/2025 9:35 PM] ursorenda
I'm relatively certain that function is bugged out, but give me a few minutes to find a solution for you


[8/11/2025 9:40 PM] ursorenda
gotchu fam, press the *forward slash* key (the one below your backspace key) to open the .esp explorer. click the magnifying glass at the top to use the search function, type in APC and hit enter. should open a virtual loot container that has the holotape in it.


[8/11/2025 9:42 PM] hanglive
that worked!!!

does anyone know if there'd be any risk in installing a few settlement thingies? (ocdecorator, etc)


[8/11/2025 10:04 PM] ursorenda
OCDecorator comes with a substantial risk of adding to save bloat, which compounds the more you use it. It won't break the game, but they are functionally safe to add. 

All settlement buildables are generally safe but I would add things in pieces as opposed to all at once, just in case. 

SS2 is *technically* safe to use, but YMMV and will also contribute substantially to save bloat. 

Transfer Settlements is safe to add, but is largely untested. Workshop Framework does what it does so for stability reasons we don't include it, lest we invoke the wrath of the conflict gods lmfao.

{Reactions}
👍

[8/11/2025 10:06 PM] ursorenda
oh also, it's worth noting that WSFW will flag your save with a warning if I don't have the same settlement mods installed. if I ever need to root around and troubleshoot for you, I have zero track on how that may affect the testing process. Though the popup window indicates that in that event I should treat that save as "unusable" so perhaps we'll learn how true that is together someday lmfao


[8/11/2025 10:07 PM] 911reg
I see, thanks lol, i guess for now i'm only gonna throw in OCD and see how it goes


[8/11/2025 10:08 PM] ursorenda
toying around with format ideas ever since @Ally_J gave me the idea, but one day we may have a settlement building competition for funsies. That'll almost definitely include OCDecorator, so get your practice in while you can :p

yeah ECO has it at the Ammunitions workbench. Unfortunately that's gonna require that you build an Engineering workbench, then a utility workbench, then unlock the ammunitions workbench from the engineering workbench using items made at the utility workbench.

[8/12/2025 6:09 PM] ursorenda
because of the Stalker theme and because the idea that bottlecaps would become currency is stupid (imo) at worst and ripe for counterfitting at best. 

A military grade cartridge could, ostensibly, also be counterfeit.... but the "military grade" prefix implies that it wouldn't actually matter if it was hand made

That's the position of the original devs, btw. if there's an outstanding push from the community to revert back to caps we wouldn't be elitist about it lol


[8/12/2025 6:09 PM] ursorenda
though I do agree that bottlecaps for currency is a lil stupid


[8/12/2025 6:13 PM] thelasttimelord
Fair enough


[8/12/2025 6:40 PM] thelasttimelord
Is it just me or are a bunch of traps invisible/inaudible? Going through the donut shop around the entrance to Concord and there's a bunch of mine danger indicators but I don't hear any explosions or anything.


[8/12/2025 6:40 PM] ursorenda
those are caltrops! you found another bug lol


[8/12/2025 6:41 PM] ursorenda
if they were mines the moment you saw the indicator you'd get an explosion within seconds (and would probably die in that particular interior without leaving it


[8/12/2025 6:42 PM] thelasttimelord
Ah, I see.


[8/12/2025 6:43 PM] ursorenda
yeah the weird part about those is they're intermittent. I went through the same area, noticed the caltrops, but didn't see the mine indicator.


[8/12/2025 8:34 PM] tiburse
Anyone here have a 4070. I want to test something


[8/12/2025 8:40 PM] 911reg
This modlist is very disappointing.
60 hours in and no cheeki breekis


[8/12/2025 8:43 PM] tiburse
I mean I would say all is good as in a 60 hour playthrough (with added mods and config changes for personal reasons) I have only had 2 crashes. One was my fault though lol.


[8/12/2025 8:45 PM] 911reg
(i'm kidding)


[8/12/2025 8:50 PM] 911reg
it is pretty crazy though, 60 hours in and no crashes whatsoever besides the pike tunnel thingy


[8/12/2025 8:50 PM] ursorenda
I'm intrigued, do 4070 ti's count?


[8/12/2025 8:50 PM] tiburse
I assumed, by how its used in the stalker series. Ironicly, I have never played stalker. Only fallout and Metro. I only know stalker from a found family member.


[8/12/2025 8:50 PM] tiburse
It might. Do you have hardware monitor?


[8/12/2025 8:51 PM] tiburse
I need you to check gpu memory temp while playing normally as well as inside vault 75.


[8/12/2025 8:56 PM] 911reg
i'm hitting 60°C on ultra, with enb, using Lossless Scaling to hit 120fps, around 70-80~ usage on heavy areas with a 4060, and a standard aio liquid cooling system


[8/12/2025 9:03 PM] tiburse
is that in the vault 75 cell or just out in the world (keep in mind this is for specifically memory on the GPU not gpu core temp)

For those wondering, this is inside the Vault 75 Cell (post elevator). It hit 104c last night. At most GPU memory chips are rated to 110c.

I did order some Thermal Grizzly TG Putty to test if its a cooling issue with the card itself. However, I haven't had temps this high in any other game that pushes the card harder.


[8/12/2025 9:35 PM] lufaine
anyone know which value corresponds to  interaction distance? like follower commands, intimidation, pacify, etc

[8/12/2025 10:37 PM] tomtombar
Yo, is there a reason the starter melee stuff like the baton or combat knife do like 3 damage?


[8/12/2025 10:52 PM] ursorenda
they haven't been balanced basically at all. They also require a large investment in both the weaponry skill and the relevant perks, which lock you into a certain type of melee weapon (blunt slash or stab)

probably will be the last combat related thing we balance


[8/12/2025 11:10 PM] tomtombar
ok, yeah i was just gonna add the MCAM melee weapons since those do quite a bit of damage, but its actually pretty accurate to the damage numbers for the guns


[8/12/2025 11:11 PM] tomtombar

It’s a known bug with that mod. Make sure you’ve applied the mcm preset and you can change the key bind in the mcm if it happens again

[8/13/2025 10:25 AM] .zathros
Does anyone know how to get Militarized Minutemen to take over the spawns? All I see is Tumbajumba's Minutemen. That's fine and all, but for me it takes away from the theme of the modpack. I have moved the mod as low as I possibly could in the plugins already.


[8/13/2025 12:27 PM] ursorenda
that's being conducted in the beta


[8/13/2025 12:28 PM] ursorenda
looks to have been removed


[8/13/2025 12:29 PM] ursorenda
The leveled lists are a bit wonky on current release, so that's likely why. Look for the next release, that specifically addresses LL


[8/13/2025 12:52 PM] Deleted User
Hey all! I’m new here. Honestly hardcore survival lists aren’t usually my cup of tea, but I love how well this list is put together. Might tweak some of the survival difficulty things in the mcm🤭

Is there an eta on the upcoming update? I read something on one of the sites about this modlist being rebuild from the ground up.  Is that a ways off in the future, or is it like looking to be the next couple of months?


[8/13/2025 1:02 PM] ursorenda
it's been rebuilt from the ground up like 5-6 times tbh 😅 

We do not have an ETA on the next release, as it's dependent on reaching a stable platform LL-wise which takes time. It's also dependent on the new Launcher being mostly bug free, which takes less time, but still takes time. 

The next release *will* require a new game, but the gameplay systems will remain the same so I would suggest just rocking the current build to get a feel of things.

It should not vanish but instead just state its broke in the inventory. We are redoing all those systems though so if there is an issue there we will catch it

due to life delaying the development of the launcher and our Beta Team reformatting we don't want to advertise a release date, even an estimate. 

But I can release that we are actively testing the current Beta, which contains LL rebalancing and Faction Changes

Next on the list will be combat system stability *then* combat balance beginning with guns and ending with melee

it's dancing between consequential and ignorable, imo. If you play like I do it's probably a good thing I've never used the weapon wheel system

Grabbed the power armor training thingy from the vertibird but still can't use the beginning power armor. Even removed an arm to make sure that it'd be below the 350 dmg resist limit... am I doing something wrong?

How can i make the flashlights brighter on those pitch black nights, its just not enough and is very weak


[8/14/2025 1:47 AM] blursedbucket
infact, the lights in general just feel almost entirely drowned out by the darkest nights


[8/14/2025 1:48 AM] thelasttimelord
I've found the night vision goggles that raiders have sometimes + flashlight work pretty great.


[8/14/2025 1:49 AM] ursorenda
that holotape isn't the PA training, it's PA *supplementary* training. 

You'll need to seek out someone to teach you how to use PA (trust us, this is necessary for balance)

BoS, Hot Roders, there's a few out there 🙂

using a flashlight attachment will swap to using that flashlight instead of the pip-light, those are always *much* brighter, though a tad bugged out.


[8/14/2025 1:50 AM] blursedbucket
I'll give that a shot

Worst case scenario, if you can't figure out how to get rid of it, use the cheat terminal Holotape to heal everything.

I did that once or twice when I was first getting used to the mod pack as I had never played fallout 4 with any kind of mod before this.


[8/14/2025 3:02 PM] corvuscoraxian
New to fallout modded (was on skyrim for so long) are there clamber mods for approaching ledges and stuff and just climbing them? Those felt like the best kind of mod to exist in games where a small rock becomes a wall.


[8/14/2025 3:03 PM] ursorenda
none exist in this modpack, though I'm sure they exist on the nexus somewhere. If you find one please be sure to throw it into the https://discord.com/channels/1113971680419782666/1364033035678384169 forum so I can pester the devs about including it (should be compatible without patching)


[8/14/2025 3:04 PM] corvuscoraxian
I'll browse for a bit. I'm bout as ignorant as they come with modding in general. Always have to have my friend hold my hand and bring a highlighter to get a new list running


[8/14/2025 3:05 PM] ursorenda
in this case it should be as simple as installing via MO2 and making sure it's at the bottom of the plugins tab, activated

Hi everyone. I tried looking around to no avail. I’ve been away for about a year so not sure if this has been answered. 

Has controller support (specifically Xbox) been added? I tried playing Anomaly last year but as someone coming from console I’m not quite use to M+K yet. Thanks! Looks great and hope to get back into it soon.


[8/14/2025 10:13 PM] ursorenda
First, sick name bruv love that band, L.D. 50 was basically my childhood anthem 😂

There’s a controller patch in the optionals section of MO2 for controller. It says PS controller but I’ve confirmed it works with controller. 

That being said, before you load the game up right click that patch and select visit on nexus. *follow the mod author’s provided instructions*

If the steam controller profile doesn’t load when you activate it: close steam, wait five seconds, open steam, activate the provided steam controller profile again.

If your pipboy wont open when you load into the game, go to the pause menu, go to keybinds in options, reset controls to default. *this will break your keybinds for m&k, all you have to do is reset to default again when you revert back to m&k*

Don’t revert to default unless your pipboy wont pipboy doesn’t work.


I apologize for the convoluted instructions, this is the only way I’ve gotten controller to work with things like weapon wheel and uneducated shooter

Why does the clothing workbench turn a perfectly good Hazmat suit into... a damaged hazmat suit? I imagine that's a holdover from some rando mod. Feels like it ought to be the other way around.

you could use bethini to change the settings to high, use vramr to compress the modpack's textures (you'd need to watch a quick 15min video on how to use it), disable ENB, set grass density to ~55-65 rather than 20, etc etc etc

Does anyone know how to turn off the depth of field effect in the game? I'm assuming it's linked to an ENB, but i cant figure out how to turn it off


[8/16/2025 8:45 AM] ursorenda
Numpad 1


[8/16/2025 11:24 AM] perinthia
What mod or setting allows you to save the game at chairs? i remember that being a thing before i set the default mod settings and would prefer to keep that one enabled if possible


[8/16/2025 12:01 PM] ursorenda
Sit save (or sleep)


[8/16/2025 12:18 PM] perinthia
Sorry i mean what mod is it listed under? i assumed it would be in gameplay but iv gone through it multiple times and didnt see anything


[8/16/2025 12:49 PM] cascade92
i mean keybind or the setting name in mod manager


[8/16/2025 12:55 PM] ursorenda
AFAIK there are no variables scopes.


[8/16/2025 12:55 PM] cascade92
aight, thanks man

Is there a way to purge rads from a settlement?


[8/16/2025 2:15 PM] tiburse
Is it in Far harbor?


[8/16/2025 2:15 PM] tiburse
Cause if a storm is there you can use the fog remover thing iirc.


[8/16/2025 2:16 PM] tiburse
If not and its like a rad storm under mod settings on the weather you can set it to clear 1 (It is what I do when I dont want to deal with it.


[8/16/2025 2:43 PM] blursedbucket
Oh you can do that? thanks for letting me know


[8/16/2025 2:44 PM] blursedbucket
That'll help massively for when im building


[8/16/2025 3:26 PM] tiburse
Thats what I use it for


[8/16/2025 3:32 PM] tiburse
Sorry, food arrived right as you asked.

You can also quickly cycle weathers with numpad /

Hi sorry, I'm not very good with discord. How do I access the support channel? Not the support forum, but the actual chat channel. I clicked the emote that's supposed to give permissions, and it did, but not to that channel or a few other ones. I'm having an issue with Wabbajack. It failed to download the two files mentioned in the install guide, so I downloaded them manually and placed them into the download folder, but wabbajack is still saying it can't download them

click create post at the top, please include screenshots of your wabba error and the folder you put the manual downloads in


[8/16/2025 4:46 PM] iunderstoodthat
Oh so there is no chat? Thanks. I'm gonna try my own troubleshooting a little longer since I can't currently get that screenshot


[8/16/2025 4:47 PM] ursorenda
It’s the “forum” format, you create a post specific to your issue


[8/16/2025 4:47 PM] ursorenda
Helps us keep track of issues better


[8/16/2025 4:49 PM] iunderstoodthat
Yeah I get that. I was just thinking you might also have a chat channel for more minor issues like a lot of other modlist discords I've seen. Plus I saw some channels in https://discord.com/channels/1113971680419782666/1259594801125392494 that seemed like what I'm looking for, but they say "no access"


[8/16/2025 4:50 PM] ursorenda
No we’re pretty set in how we are willing to provide support. If it helps, based on the context provided you either are putting the manually downloaded files in the wrong folder (they need to be in the folder you designated for downloads) or you’re unpacking the archives before you out them in there. They need to remain packed (zipped)


[8/16/2025 4:51 PM] ursorenda
If that doesn’t help, please create a support ticket


[8/16/2025 4:51 PM] iunderstoodthat
I didn't do either of those, but I'll gladly make a post once I'm done with my second attempt at installing

This is a common issue with wabbajack itself but once our launcher is released this will be handled better


[8/16/2025 4:56 PM] iunderstoodthat
Nice. I love standalone launchers


[8/16/2025 4:57 PM] iunderstoodthat
btw I wasn't suggesting y'all change anything. just explaining the source of my confusion


[8/16/2025 4:57 PM] nomad5157
if you scroll up in messages you can see some screenshots


[8/16/2025 4:57 PM] nomad5157
You are good no worries at all


[8/16/2025 5:49 PM] iunderstoodthat
wahoo! all I had to do was re-run the install. It downloaded a bunch of extra stuff the second go around. idk what what's about, but wabbajack gonna wabbajack. thanks guys


[8/16/2025 5:58 PM] dilldoeshwaggins
i noticed for any mod pack you gotta run wabba like 2 sometimes 3 times to get all the files and data. its so much it can get lost on exchange.


[8/16/2025 6:17 PM] lufaine
Is there a way to craft pulse/cryo/plasma grenades?

I can't recall atm you may need to have them crafted at the proper workbenh...we have like 10 different ones


[8/16/2025 6:31 PM] lufaine
found it after digging through xedit, it's in weapon smith bench instead of explosives :confuseddoggo:


[8/16/2025 6:41 PM] nomad5157
hmm yea we should get those moved


[8/16/2025 7:46 PM] ursorenda
with later game perks and associated attributes, I believe so. 

Explosives, i believe are what you would want to focus on, but it's probably also associated with secondary attributes like science, especially for something like cryo grenades


[8/16/2025 8:29 PM] weabootyler
hmm wabbajack doesnt seem to want to download ENB or the Anamoly hud file. Do i just manually download them and drop them into the wabbajack install folder?

[8/16/2025 11:52 PM] 911reg
or, i think it was in some .ini file inside the game's folder

can you take like 10-20% off for like 10 seconds so we can respond?


[8/17/2025 12:05 AM] walterremixedyoshi
because the grim screenshots dont look like how it looks in game?


[8/17/2025 12:05 AM] walterremixedyoshi
um ok?..


[8/17/2025 12:07 AM] ursorenda
because you're spamming faster than we can formulate cohesive responses to your feedback. We appreciate hearing from the community but like... chill on the speedrun lol

when you say washed out, which ENBs do you believe fit that descriptor?


[8/17/2025 12:08 AM] walterremixedyoshi
didnt think it was spam my bad but there is no support chat area that i see


[8/17/2025 12:09 AM] ursorenda
we use support tickets to keep better track, but it seems like your more interested in chatting about which ENBs do what, which is fine here 

https://discord.com/channels/1113971680419782666/1315750844964016238 for future ref

in our beta phase we're more interested in exploring stability, then balance, then bespoke additions. 

After we've cleared stable 1.0.0 we may explore vanity projects like gun inspections


[8/17/2025 12:47 AM] walterremixedyoshi
also some guns audio is broken and sounds super muffled


[8/17/2025 12:48 AM] ursorenda
that's what the https://discord.com/channels/1113971680419782666/1315750844964016238 is for, feel free to throw a ticket out for any guns you identify as broken . We can't really do anything with "some guns"

There is a quest attached to it. When you talk to the robot outside of it


[8/17/2025 12:55 AM] ursorenda
technically you're intended to find the voice box module within the concord museum, but you can absolutely use it's facilities without doing so. I believe that quest was intended to be expanded upon but atm our deployment just has the one. 

It's not my favorite addition, but lots of users like it lol


[8/17/2025 12:56 AM] ursorenda
oh also I think there are some vanity functions that require the quest completion but I couldn't tell you for certain, as I haven't tested it

Okay, Genuinely, is it supposed to be impossible to craft most ammo types or am I just being silly? I have at least 30s in almost all crafting related perks, and a 100 in Gunsmith


[8/17/2025 1:15 AM] brotherarkon
Is there something im supposed to get to unlock the rest of the ammos? or did I kinda throw a run


[8/17/2025 1:20 AM] ursorenda
We haven’t touched workshop stuff yet, at the moment ECO locks ammo crafting behind a bespoke bench. 

You have to build the engineering bench, unlock the utility bench, then craft the materials to unlock the ammo bench


We agree, that’s convoluted. When we reach a calmer state of change it’s going to be addressed. For now, use the console to meet the crafting requirements to unlock the ammo bench


[8/17/2025 1:20 AM] brotherarkon
The thing is I have the bench

[8/17/2025 1:34 AM] ursorenda
yup. for balance reasons (becuase of Bastion) you'll need to seek out a faction that can teach you how to use PA. 

BoS is the easiest, but there are a few other factions that can


[8/17/2025 1:39 AM] walterremixedyoshi
u do understand how it can be confusing once u get this u think u already know how to use it

[8/17/2025 2:31 AM] ursorenda
I definitely appreciate the feedback. That last sentence in the popup is supposed to illustrate what I communicated above. That PA training is intended, for balance reasons, to be a later game acquisition. 

It's absolutely a shared sentiment across the community that PA training should be better communicated through natural conveyance, that's just later on our list of priorities. Currently our priorities fall a little closer towards balancing the LL, the damage values, the armor values, and the combat AI. 

We don't make these mods, we're just in the business of trying to make them work together. We definitely appreciate things like this being pointed out, just in the appropriate channels. 

The support forum is where you should be sharing these. If it becomes too much for you to want to bother, then I'll ask you to give us the space to finish working through our beta to balance these things. The next release will be more to your liking, based on the criticism you've provided thus far. We've removed a lot of weapons, added a few more armors, and are creating the QC platforms to balance all of them. 

Please do not share any further inbalances in general chat. Make a support ticket. Thanks.

I like that stuff generally stays dead, you can clean up entire towns, make a change in the world


[8/17/2025 2:29 PM] weabootyler
This maybe a dumb question but with the pack and ENB. Does ENB automatically choose the preset file you all have setup or should I go into ENB to enable it?


[8/17/2025 2:38 PM] nomad5157
its already set up


[8/17/2025 2:48 PM] iunderstoodthat
that's a vanilla survival thing btw. stuff still respawns but it takes a long time. 30 days of not loading the cell iirc


[8/17/2025 3:01 PM] ursorenda
For the various presets you just activate it, make sure you only have one enabled


[8/17/2025 3:02 PM] ursorenda
My understanding is that the [cleared] tag will leave after they respawn


[8/17/2025 3:18 PM] nomad5157
The respawn time for cells has been increased a good bit in anomaly

oh no my bad, was my antivirus


[8/17/2025 5:14 PM] ursorenda
you need to whitelist the installation and download folders in windows defender. 

Windows Defender will flag unregistered .dll files as viruses. It's a normal thing, mostly because modders don't want to pay microsoft $400 to register their mod


[8/17/2025 5:15 PM] retr0bruh
yeah, who would pay 400 dollars for something so simple like register a mod lmao

or, a way to 'delete' them via console? (if that's even safe)


[8/17/2025 8:42 PM] nomad5157
Some can I believe IHO has a tool for it. I would not try to delete them but you can click on console and type in disable but that will just make them invisible

it's under the MCM settings for Workshop Framework, I can't remember where exactly but IIRC it's under power options

Only issues being Yellow american flag and trudies diner is a void if you are inside it, worth it if you ask me

I would just be worried about save bloat with that


[8/18/2025 9:16 AM] blursedbucket
I was also originally going to try running that with Anomaly but there was a reason I decided to not go through with it and I dont remember what it was exactly, just compatibility with some mods already in the modlist


[8/18/2025 9:18 AM] tiburse
Ill be back in a bit. Gotta step away.

I did find compatibility for a few things, munitions and xdi fixes so far, running well


[8/18/2025 9:21 AM] blursedbucket
Mmmm, That was one of them, its incompatible with mods that alter Ghouls


[8/18/2025 9:21 AM] blursedbucket
in this case, they're replaced by zombies


[8/18/2025 9:21 AM] drakodraconis
So far? no issues with em


[8/18/2025 9:22 AM] blursedbucket
Apparently it causes quests from Sims settlements 2 to not work properly, like "HUB of the Problem"


[8/18/2025 9:23 AM] drakodraconis
I was worried bout that one, but it actually didn't have an issue after a magnuson terminal patch


[8/18/2025 9:23 AM] drakodraconis
it forces one to spawn with the card needed


[8/18/2025 9:23 AM] drakodraconis

[8/18/2025 9:26 AM] blursedbucket
hmm, could you keep me updated (if you remember) on how it goes, because I do like SS2 and if you do not encounter any issues for a while I'd be interested in knowing what you patched to get it working

[8/18/2025 3:09 PM] ursorenda
that is considered *supplementary* to PA training, you still need to find someone to teach you how to use PA


[8/18/2025 3:09 PM] carcanodolly
So it is not a Bug and I just need someone to teach me


[8/18/2025 3:09 PM] ursorenda

to complete the concord sequence I would take out the guy on the roof opposite you, then either head back down to the bottom or parkour to the church roof on your left


[8/18/2025 3:11 PM] carcanodolly
Ohh yeah I’ll do that it’s a cool feature btw it never made sense to me how a civilian could use power armor perfectly fine without ever seeing one up close or from the inside 😅


[8/18/2025 3:12 PM] ursorenda
lore wise, the male PC was in the army and used PA. Female PC did not.

Regardless PA at that point in the game would make all of the hardcore elements of our modpack a big silly joke, so we added in the PA training mod


[8/18/2025 3:14 PM] carcanodolly
Agreed I think it’s just too early to throw a whole set of power armor at our feet at basically the beginning of the game xD I’d rather play without and suffer


[8/18/2025 3:18 PM] blursedbucket
do the enclave also teach you or should i go get the training first from elsewhere

[8/18/2025 3:19 PM] blursedbucket
well you've required training in all the previous games so i dont know why its like this in fallout 4

[8/18/2025 3:30 PM] carcanodolly
Really? Fallout 4 is actually my first fallout game I didn’t played the others😅 yeah doesn’t make sense why they didn’t add it to fallout 4 then


[8/18/2025 3:33 PM] blursedbucket
Well, in Fallout 1 and 2 you actually didn't need training, however it was placed very far late game and won't stumble upon it early game; Thus balances it.
In Fallout 3 and New Vegas you can get them fairly easy, at any time, thus they decided to balance it by requiring training to be able to use them -


[8/18/2025 3:34 PM] blursedbucket
Fallout 4 you get it early, so why did they not include power armor training? we'll never know I guess

Honestly? You guys prioritized the most important things first which is definitely noticeable I’m usually not a fan of survival mode in modlists because your biggest enemy is not the game difficulty but the constant crashing you encounter in so many lists..playing for hours now and didn’t had a single crash so amazing work you guys did there 😋🙌

How would one go about creating a character build based on the punisher? Something that I think perfectly matches the sole survivor given that he’s a former soldier who loses his family who translates that pain into eradicating the scum in the commonwealth.


[8/18/2025 9:08 PM] tiburse
I would look at how people have done that in DND and translate it into Fallout in terms of weapons. As traditional DND settings are fantasy and lack guns. They use archery, thus I would move that to handguns/longun so if we are going traditional Frank I would say Glock19 and an M4. If you develop the character more into fallout, power armor / heavy id say .50cal and flamethrower.


[8/18/2025 9:19 PM] .tval
I’ve never played DND so I don’t really know much about it. Not sure what to put into special at the beginning, have a few ideas for tag skills like longarm and handguns.


[8/18/2025 9:22 PM] suder1111
Isn't the punishers "superpower" his willpower? Too determined and too angry to die. I'd build around that, like pile endurance and health perks, and then focus on guns and more weapons.


[8/18/2025 9:27 PM] tiburse
Hmm, looking at the below link I would say endurance(con), Agi, for vats given his gun use, and str for his build. https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/3bgzne/just_a_frank_castlepunisher_build_in_5e_raw/

i gotta be the one or few that thinks the show kinda stinks. its setting a story that us as the players make in fallout. visuals are great!!! sets look good. but the story was always suppose to be random. the only set things in fallout was side lore and prewar info pertaining to bombs falling and communist fights.


[8/18/2025 10:25 PM] dilldoeshwaggins

Using a combination of VRAMr and CAO i managed to downsize all the textures in the modpack to a mere 1 gb without breaking anything xD


[8/19/2025 1:50 AM] therhythmz
Why? Because i can. It provides absolutely zero performance advantages aside from smiting any lag in weapon draw, but if some dev manages to reduce the draw calls even more it might be possible to make it run even on 8 gigs of ddr3 on an old-ass pc.


[8/19/2025 1:53 AM] therhythmz
Also, most are vanilla size, but some tiny ones are 256 in size. Might be worth it to make the pack payable in handhelds, since due to having a tiny screen the HD textures may be irrelevant.

[8/19/2025 3:08 AM] therhythmz (pinned)
Since you're the supreme overlord I'll tell you how. Its not hard, it just takes a long-ass time. Just run VRAMr on Vanilla settings, no hassle since it is designed to work on entire modlists. Back up the output on another folder out of harm's way, which should be 11 or so gigs worth of loose files. Afterwards, treat the VRAMr output mod you generated as a single mod inside Cathedral. 

Enable these: Extract BSA, Create BSA, Delete source files (this is because if you don't, the resulting output will get mixed in with the rest of the VRAMr folder), Create dummy plugin, Necessary Optimizations, Compress Textures, and Generate Mipmaps. 

Disable these: Delete backups, and Allow compression (in the BSA settings tab, not the Textures tab, they're compressing different stuff) and then set Downsizing on a ratio of 2, (or 4 if you want to crush them on 500 mb lmao).

Put the VRAMr Output mod above the Flashlight Replace mod, and then put the crushed Cathedral mod below the VRAMr Output. 

On the plugin side, put the dummy plugin for texture loading above all PRPs, just below "Anomaly Merged Textures v2" and thats it.

The entire collection of textures get smooshed into a single ominous BA2 file and a dumy plugin.

Now you can freely enable and disable the enshittification of all textures on two levels without conflicting with anything. 

For most people the 11 gig VRAMr output alone is enough to make the game playable on an average mid-low  tier rig, but I'm running it on an i3 office laptop with no GPU and 8 gigs of ram. Reducing texture loading times to the absolute minimum was the main reason for it since my ram is slow, not to mention my old-ass SATA SSD D: drive. With that D: drive being an absolute dinosaur there was absolutely no way i could get away with loading stuff from pagefile. Its not even an M.2 lmao its a dang SATA drive.


[8/19/2025 3:14 AM] therhythmz
With my absolute potato specs you might guess i play at 5 fps, but i actually run at 30fps semi-stable outdoors (with a few stutters every now and then). Indoors its mostly 60fps.


[8/19/2025 3:17 AM] therhythmz
If you want, i can pack the reduced 500mb version on a zip and put it on Gdrive or something. It works without the VRAMr output. I would offer uploading the 11 gig version, but i live in Venezuela and it would be impossible using my internet.  That's the most i can upload anywhere without the upload failing.

High being uncompressed, med being 66% compression, and low being 33?


[8/19/2025 4:34 AM] tiburse
Because if we premtively compress them it could just be tied into the launcher setting as well. As an "optional"


[8/19/2025 4:34 AM] ursorenda
we could definitely run it in the launcher but we would need to address the various visual issues before we run lower performance options via compression

like a consumable? Actually don't think I'd mind collecting 'batteries' to keep em operational. If anything that kinda feels nifty.


[8/19/2025 3:04 PM] corvuscoraxian
Glitchy if broken since I keep seeing broken stuff also sounds fun.


[8/19/2025 3:06 PM] quizzling
It would be cool if it was something that you actually need to keep an eye on, rare, and required by more than just 1 thing to make you think about using them as an active choice


[8/19/2025 3:07 PM] nomad5157
We've actually had the pipboy require a battery before and if you didn't keep it charged it would give off rads. We also had the metro battery charger in to charge it it may or may not make a return but we are looking to do a lot with the flashlight


[8/19/2025 3:08 PM] corvuscoraxian
Rads would destroy me. Already having trouble figuring out how to keep rads low. Cant find anything outside of visiting doctors to get rid of rads


[8/19/2025 3:09 PM] corvuscoraxian
as much as i hate wearing those masks 24/7 just cant not wear one. Always picking up rad sickness


[8/19/2025 3:09 PM] quizzling
The Metro Battery Charger sounds like a neat thing, gotta keep your lights and/or goggles charged and using more than 1 at a time drains charge way quicker


[8/19/2025 3:53 PM] lostmikely
Is there some kind of gameplay guide or am I figuring everything out on my own?


[8/19/2025 5:09 PM] heichou
Keep X-111 Stims and Ca-DTPA on you. As long as you have those, you can manage rads


[8/19/2025 5:09 PM] heichou

[8/19/2025 5:57 PM] ursorenda
My personal recommendation is to dive in now, considering we don’t have a release date for 0.6.0

Gives you time to get familiar with the way the modpack works.


Three pieces of advice (one of them is a technical step):

immediately after you reach the top of the elevator, hit tab. If you don’t you won’t be able to select a background (also, avoid backgrounds that involve tech weapons, you won’t find much ammo for them)

after you apply the mcm preset and reload your game, make sure you head back into the vault to grab the med items provided. You *will* need them.

When leaving sanctuary there’s a mailbox just before the bridge that always has two grenades. You will *need* those grenades 🙃

I removed it, but you can hold off on reporting it in the support forum. We're aware of that one and have yet to do a sweep on visual bugs. 

I appreciate you pointing it out, regardless!

no worries at all my friend


[8/20/2025 2:11 AM] lostmikely
I chose the military background and received a 9 mm pistol with like 10 rounds. But I had 50 10 mm rounds. So I had so much ammo I couldn’t use. Is that intended or an oversight/bug?

I got killed by bloatflies in Sanctuary trying to knife them, then I let Codsworth take care of the first ones, but still had to use every single bullet on radroaches anyway. 🤣


[8/20/2025 2:11 AM] lostmikely
I never thought I’d say I got killed by bloatflies.

[8/20/2025 2:29 AM] ursorenda
melee is whole sale unablanced atm (it's also tied to the weaponry attribute and the strength SPECIAL) 

The decision to make the "starter pistol" a 9mm was a slight oversight in that we didn't change the Vault 111 ammo loot to 9mm lmfao. I would honestly recommend going back to that save and choosing a diff background

Did that and now the next problem, saving at chairs prompt doesn't show up anymore 😩


[8/20/2025 4:08 AM] ursorenda
sorry for the delay, (honestly I should be in bed but i got up to pee lmfao) 

When you pause and choose exit to desktop it will create a volatile exit save (meaning it will only work once and then that save will disappear) 

Try that and see if saves will come back. As a side note, chair saves will not work if you are crouched or in combat. 


As a secondary (or alternative) option, you can use the forward slash ( [ \ ] key that is under the backspace key) to open the mod explorer. Sometimes it will take a few presses before it opens. If you use the search function (again, sometimes it takes a few clicks to activate, bear with us it's loading over 800 mods) and type in survival pack that'll open a virtual container with survival packs. Those commit "hard saves" that will never be over written. Chair saves will only commit the 3 most recent :p


[8/20/2025 4:10 AM] lostmikely
No worries dude, really nice of you to help out! I'll try what you said 🙂

the chair save system uses a perk injection to make chair saveable. That bug comes from randomness causing the perk to unallign with your PC. We dunno why it does that lmfao


[8/20/2025 4:14 AM] ursorenda
glad it worked out for you though ❤️


[8/20/2025 4:15 AM] lostmikely
interesting... I'm a hobbyist programmer and in my childhood I scripted my own San Andreas Multiplayer servers, so I recognize the need to do odd unstable workarounds to be able to do things otherwise not possible


[8/20/2025 4:18 AM] ursorenda
the save system in general is a bid to prevent as much of the inherent save bloat that's committed by standard saves as possible. I'm not a dev (I just coordinate the teams and manage the community :p) but my understanding is that both the chair saves and the survival packs are highly preferable to most anything else due to how it calls the CK to commit a save. I couldn't tell you what the call specifically is, only that it's unique from the pause menu save or the auto save function


[8/20/2025 4:19 AM] ursorenda

Thinking about installing this modpack but not sure how the settlement building and power armour works? Anyone have any videos or something.


[8/20/2025 4:17 PM] tiburse
Power armor you learn from any of the mainstay factions that use it once you get far enough in their story. Along with learning how to use more and better suits via holotapes found in the world.


[8/20/2025 4:19 PM] tiburse
For settlements, I might have added 4 or 5 mods to give me more things within.  However, adding mods to the pack is unsupported. I am currently working out kinks with the ones I have and load order.


[8/20/2025 5:06 PM] thegamesmith
Is sim settlements in this?


[8/20/2025 5:07 PM] tiburse
It is not, If you look under User modded Anomaly Some have attempted to get it going with varying degrees of success. I will say so far I have been having some luk with the mods in the following image.

You might want to grab Settlement Menu manager for Workshop rearranged, this modlist still uses workshop framework and it normally prone to crashes when using rearranged with it, SMM sorts it right out and puts it in it's own menu too 🙌

SS2 is a "use at your own risk" category mod, it is compatible but will spike your save bloat considerably and limit the total playtime of a given save

just wondering, is anyone else crashing when building?


[8/21/2025 7:46 AM] nomad5157
Concord is not just a starter area now. It is brutal. 

Use Cdpta to help manage your rads. If you leave your rads untreated you will get sick which can lead to diseases etc. Next update we have coming out here within a week or so will be making changes to this system to be more user friendly 🙂


[8/21/2025 7:47 AM] mr.dripler
Is there a location (other than lower left by the ap/hp) that i could track my rads? I couldn't see it in Pipboy (also could just be missing it, again kinda fucking stupid)


[8/21/2025 7:47 AM] nomad5157
Ifyou're getting crashes please make a support post


[8/21/2025 7:48 AM] nomad5157
There is active effects tab that can give you more info in the pipboy


[8/21/2025 7:48 AM] pancakefuhrer

[8/21/2025 7:49 AM] nomad5157
no worries, any crashing we want to hear about


[8/21/2025 7:51 AM] mr.dripler
That's where I saw the cesium sickness and such but I don't recall seeing a Rad count but I'll have to double check when I get home tonight. But with having these issues will the Cdpta help reduce/remove the current sicknesses or is this a "in the future" kind of thing


[8/21/2025 7:53 AM] nomad5157
The cdpta helps cure rads/ira but in the current version it can be a bit buggy so if cdpta does not help you at all going to a doctor will cure it


[8/21/2025 7:53 AM] nomad5157
If you look in https://discord.com/channels/1113971680419782666/1236716935228424305 you can see the corrected method


[8/21/2025 7:55 AM] mr.dripler
Gotcha, thanks! I'm sure I'll be back with more questions later on. Last one before I go, as far as starting areas go, as you have stated it all seems shit across the board, is there a recommended for newer players to this mod pack or is like when you first start Tarkov, you're going to die ALOT and you've just gotta learn.


[8/21/2025 7:58 AM] nomad5157
Headshots are lethal for you and the characters in game. You can expect to die a lot lol. You can make survival packs at the chem bench which allows you to save. You can save at chairs but there are a few issues with this. This also will be addressed in the next patch coming with the radiation changes soon.


[8/21/2025 7:59 AM] mr.dripler

[8/21/2025 1:41 PM] cascade92

It isn't just piper, but since you mention it I thought it was just a visual thing on my end. Its the Apoc outfit in general then. I wasn't gonna say anything xD cas I thought it was something I did


[8/21/2025 1:54 PM] nomad5157
When is the last time you updated the list


[8/21/2025 1:57 PM] cascade92
like 2 years lmao


[8/21/2025 1:58 PM] nomad5157
yea thats why, lol


[8/21/2025 1:58 PM] cascade92
i know it was updated a bit more and the mines were toned down, but holy hell how did it pass testing


[8/21/2025 1:58 PM] cascade92
i thought about updating, the mini map and stuff kinda turned me away


[8/21/2025 1:59 PM] nomad5157
Sir, that was several versions ago


[8/21/2025 1:59 PM] nomad5157
and was removed like a year ago


[8/21/2025 1:59 PM] cascade92
would a save from 2 years ago version work with the present game?


[8/21/2025 2:00 PM] nomad5157
no


[8/21/2025 2:00 PM] cascade92
well thats a shame


[8/21/2025 2:00 PM] cascade92
I'll wait until the fallout phase comes back in 6 or so months to start again

[8/21/2025 2:01 PM] cascade92
plus i've added 50 or so mods, and i'm not tryna redo all the edits again lol


[8/21/2025 2:01 PM] nomad5157
I think you have a misunderstanding of the theme of the current list


[8/21/2025 2:01 PM] cascade92
its it not similar?


[8/21/2025 2:02 PM] cascade92
because I love my version, the only issue is that food and water havent been an issue in a long time


[8/21/2025 2:03 PM] nomad5157
What do you mean the fallout phase? There is no fallout content removed


[8/21/2025 2:05 PM] cascade92
Do you play fallout a lot or you mostly enjoy the modding part of it?


[8/21/2025 2:06 PM] nomad5157
Both, there are several fallout related quests added in, several new radios based on fallout. The only thing that isn't really "Fallout" is the healing system


[8/21/2025 2:06 PM] nomad5157
and combat is a lot more extreme of course


[8/21/2025 2:07 PM] nomad5157
we also have added in several player homes that fit the fallout/wasteland vibe


[8/21/2025 2:07 PM] cascade92
I'm not refering to any content, by "fallout phase" im talking about that period of time every once in a while where you want to play fallout


[8/21/2025 2:07 PM] nomad5157
So vanilla?


[8/21/2025 2:07 PM] cascade92
no


[8/21/2025 2:08 PM] cascade92
No matter how many mods you add, this is still fallout 4, I love this game and the series. All the mods do are make it a better and more enjoyable experience. I enjoy playing a better, more quality version of the game, but only a couple playthroughs a year


[8/21/2025 2:09 PM] cascade92
so when i play fallout, i want to play the best version possible, and this modlist is that, but i'm gonna wait till i really wanna play it again to do a new playthrough and update


[8/21/2025 2:10 PM] nomad5157
Gotcha


[8/21/2025 2:11 PM] nomad5157
Well, we can't support older versions so if you need support you will need to update


[8/21/2025 2:11 PM] nomad5157
There are several improvements in the new version and we are making balance changes for the better everyday so hope to see you on the updated version sometime soon


[8/21/2025 3:32 PM] umwavy

lvl 62, I'm kind of OP, wanna make the world more brutal and difficult, any recommendations on changes I can make?


[8/21/2025 7:37 PM] ursorenda
you can tweak the global damage values in the MCM under True Damage


[8/21/2025 7:37 PM] ursorenda
you can try a pistols only playstyle


[8/21/2025 7:37 PM] ursorenda
you can try a melee playstyle :p


[8/21/2025 7:38 PM] ursorenda
those last two will be filled with suffering even at lvl 62


[8/21/2025 7:38 PM] ursorenda
actually *especially* because you're lvl 62, due to enemy scaling


[8/21/2025 7:48 PM] sirandronidas
hell yeah


[8/21/2025 8:19 PM] camthefriendly
Hey, I'm sorry to bother ya'll but my StoryTeller companion f'd off with a ton of my shit in his inventory. And he's not at the 'dugout inn' like the game said he would be. I tried using the prid posted by another chatter from march (thanks search function in discord) but it says it's not a reference to a valid id


[8/21/2025 8:22 PM] camthefriendly
can anyone either tell me how to get his id via console commands  (from one of my ealier saves) or..


[8/21/2025 8:26 PM] ursorenda
didn't see this. If you have an earlier save you can open the console and click on him to get his ID's. I can't remember off the top of my head which specific ID you'll need but if you highlight him (he'll be all blue) his ID's will show on the right. 


Then you can use [RefID].moveto player


[8/21/2025 8:29 PM] camthefriendly
It's 7900467e when I click them in a earlier save


[8/21/2025 8:29 PM] ursorenda
then the console command would be 7900467e.moveto player


[8/21/2025 8:30 PM] ursorenda
I'd take a screenshot with win + shift + S before you hop over just in case it might be one of the other IDs


[8/21/2025 8:31 PM] camthefriendly
It worked. Thank you


[8/21/2025 8:31 PM] camthefriendly
i didn't know it needed to have the period seperator either, so thanks twice

[8/22/2025 12:39 PM] mr.dripler
with water pumps is it a steady passive accumilation of water bottles or do you actively need to do things?


[8/22/2025 1:21 PM] tiburse
Best would be set it to where it only appears if part is injured


[8/22/2025 1:46 PM] ursorenda
You can play with condition boy but afaik he’s not hideable


[8/22/2025 1:52 PM] tiburse

Hi all! Is it possible to tweak NPC accuracy? I'm kind of sick of them killing me with a headshot every single time, like they almost never miss


[8/22/2025 3:46 PM] ursorenda
tweaking NPC accuracy isn't something that's easily done, unfortunately. You can try lowering the global damage values in True Damage, from within the MCM.

Unfortunately, the point of this modpack is that combat is intended to be very, *very* unforgiving. I hate to quote everyone's favorite community to hate but.... The only real solution (lower dmg values will help, but not fix the issue) is to get better at planning your combat encounters. you gotta get gud :p

I run from 90% of combat encounters, as a frame of reference. It's usually a huge undertaking to kill more than 1 super mutant and there's *always* more than 1 super mutant lmfao

I understand all that, but I'm cleaning up Corvega now, and there's this guy standing on the other end of the room looking at the other direction, I shoot him in the head but don't kill him because he has a helmet, so he just does 180 and kills me in the head in 0.01 seconds. I understand the realism and all that, but that's not very realistic


[8/22/2025 5:11 PM] ursorenda
you're always welcome to your opinion. Corvega was a challenge for me as well, which again is the whole point of the modpack. If I can clear it, you can clear it. Promise.

[8/23/2025 9:49 AM] dilldoeshwaggins
so did i lol. it took a few hours. its just getting a better angle than them. avoiding turrets. also i found these synth grenades that spawn a synth and attack things lol. those are in corvega somewhere if you can find them. i dont want to reveal that as it was fun to stumble into lol. alls i can say is look for a sewer drain entrance


[8/23/2025 9:50 AM] dilldoeshwaggins
worth is plus good energy ammo. also any human takes good ballistic damage. heavy armor can be negated with energy or plasma


[8/23/2025 9:51 AM] invitedhydra64

Hey, anyone playing in 21:9? id like to know the settings for ultra wide interface if possible. Its not unplayable but a little off with scopes and the hud.


[8/23/2025 4:46 PM] camthefriendly
I have another question, fellows. When a perk mentions vafs and vans, which system is the one the game is using for the "slow time" hotkey:G. I am not sure if I've wasted 4 perks or not, and think it would be funny if the mysterious stranger would show up, if the vafs/vans perks even apply now with all these heavy modifications we've made


[8/23/2025 4:58 PM] ursorenda
mysterious stranger, IIRC, is not compatble with VAFS atm


[8/23/2025 4:58 PM] ursorenda
but the ones that affect things like accuracy and damage are

Would the smokeable cigarette to save mod be safe to add to this?

we're actually looking at replacing chair saves with that mod

is the fov slider in the mcm the right way to change fov? somehow it wont accept the prefered fov, console commands wont stick either


[8/23/2025 6:20 PM] vaelr
is there any place to share builds? would be nice to see how others come up with ways of surviving

[8/23/2025 9:36 PM] ursorenda
We removed it because no one used it 🙃


[8/23/2025 9:37 PM] ursorenda
There’s a mod under interface called FOV slider, is that what you used?


[8/23/2025 10:00 PM] sirandronidas
Is there an easy way to make loot a lot more scarce?


[8/23/2025 10:24 PM] patronskii
Anyway to hide armour pieaces so they dont clip into eachother?


[8/23/2025 10:52 PM] .zathros
This makes me happy. I want to start a new playthrough. i took a break for a bit. But I have never touched the DLCs within fallout 4 so I want to use Anomaly to play them. Other mod packs that I've played just dont give the same vibe of actually fighting to survive as this one does lol


[8/23/2025 11:11 PM] .zathros
Also, Is the Homeplate decorated mod safe? I havent seen anyone on here try it


[8/23/2025 11:31 PM] ursorenda
We’re dont touch homeplate at all so should be

Which one


[8/24/2025 3:59 AM] ursorenda
lmfao yes please share


[8/24/2025 3:59 AM] ursorenda
no, but you would alt+F4 and reboot


[8/24/2025 4:26 AM] salvadorre
tried multiple times, didn't help. But i just reloaded an older save and went from there


[8/24/2025 4:26 AM] salvadorre
so far didn't happen again


[8/24/2025 4:32 AM] ursorenda
it's called script lag. CK games get it all the time, the more you mess with the scripts (or add scripts) the more likely it is to happen. 

If it ever happens repeatedly please make sure you make a support ticket 🙂


[8/24/2025 6:15 AM] yami_ger
rebuuild collection and the packaged pack for that caused previs issues or texture issue


[8/24/2025 6:46 AM] tiburse
Speaking of that


[8/24/2025 6:46 AM] tiburse
I need to file a bug report lol

You need to check your dm history 🙃

Idk if anyone else has encountered this but when i switch enbs in mo2 i feel like im not noticing a difference in game, like the colors are the same


[8/24/2025 3:20 PM] ursorenda
It’s a known bug atm, you can install enbs directly to your stock folder

[8/24/2025 8:14 PM] blursedbucket
You can disable grain under post processing in ENB menu, you know how to open that?


[8/24/2025 8:36 PM] porkchop9504
Wanted to ask about disabling the wetsuit trapper mods or usmc gunners, would that start crashing the game or would that maybe just screw npc inventories? Like if i waited 2 in game days would that reset npc inventories? I know not to disable mods mid playthrough but im just curious if they are baked into the list and other patches or if they could be replaced?


[8/24/2025 8:40 PM] ursorenda
I don’t think you’ll be able to due to patches requiring it as a master. You’ll get an instant crash/failure to load if that’s the case. If not, all G man go for it. 

The next update, however, you will not be able to disable them. They will absolutely be required by faction patches


[8/24/2025 8:42 PM] camthefriendly
Pardon, but I apparently have a juggernaut plate debuffing me and I have 'replaced' it with medium junk plates twice now, but it still shows under my active effects in the stats menu


[8/24/2025 8:43 PM] porkchop9504
ahhh okay gotcha appreciate the response! im fine w the gunner usmc faction look, im using the wetsuit collection for my enclave playthrough so seeing the far harbor crabbing raiders with high tech lookin gear is kinda jarring lol , but not a huge deal tho and this is just a nit pick overall amazing mod list

[8/24/2025 8:48 PM] camthefriendly
I have tried replacing it with not 'junk' small plates and it is not effective in removing the debuff. Neither was using the 'reset' this mod button in the mod config for replacable armor plates


[8/24/2025 8:59 PM] camthefriendly
Doles anyone have the item code for the juggernaut plate?


[8/24/2025 8:59 PM] camthefriendly
apparently, according to a post on the mod itself, if you have it in your inventory, and equip it, you can fix the bug


[8/24/2025 9:00 PM] ursorenda
Open up the modlsit explorer with forwsrd slash (key under backspace) and search for juggernaut plate.

Sometimes you have to press the key a few times for it to come up


[8/24/2025 9:03 PM] camthefriendly
life saver, thank you


[8/24/2025 9:06 PM] camthefriendly
For anyopne else who may experience that bug, here are the instructions to follow, to fix it when used in conjunction with the mod explorer

[8/24/2025 11:01 PM] camthefriendly
I am posting this, stolen, from the nexus mod posts page that I followed. For anyone experiencing effects get stuck on character: (Speed sprint bug)

1. Make sure slot 56 is free. Some mods have armor or similar which may occupy this slot. 
2. Reset mod in MCM. 
3. Equip the same type of plate the effect was from (In my case "Small Plate (Slightly Damaged)"). You can use "Active Effects on HUD" mod by Wolfmark to see the plate variant in question. 
4. Unequip said plate. 
5. Success! Effects should be removed.  
Just fully unequip all items from your apparel tab so you are wearing nothing before performing this fix.

Wait wait wait, i was just reading through previous comments here. We're able to switch enb presets through MO2 itself?


[8/25/2025 12:08 AM] invitedhydra64
Stumbled upon the "in the flesh" quest/dungeon. Was wandering around for about an hour and a half and didn't find a single chair to save at, then died 🙂


[8/25/2025 12:09 AM] invitedhydra64
There's a divider in MO2 that's called ENBs or something, you can change presets there

the stable release, they aren't working for some reason. They're working on beta, though. 

For now, you'll have to install them manually to the Stock Folder *inside* your installation directory (*not* your steam directory, where you installed FOA)

[8/25/2025 5:39 PM] dragonpalm
Reading the special recommends, I usually go for charisma and int first to pass early checks but I see that things work differently here


[8/25/2025 5:40 PM] ursorenda
speech checks are migrated to a attribute rather than base charisma. 

Intelligence still governs exp gain universally


[8/25/2025 5:41 PM] dragonpalm
Is perception still the sniper stat? I always end up becoming a sniper


[8/25/2025 5:43 PM] ursorenda
governs mostly accuracy with longarms. It does influence damage values for longarms but more so influenced by the longarms attribute. you won't see much affect until about 50 points in. 

Most of the damage affecting systems are baked into perks, to answer the obvious next question. You will need to invest into longarms in order to acquire said perks. 

Handguns are tied to Agility and the handgun attribute


[8/25/2025 5:43 PM] dragonpalm
*50?!*


[8/25/2025 5:43 PM] ursorenda
I'm editting my commment hold lol

so there's a second layer of skills to progress in this list


[8/25/2025 5:45 PM] dragonpalm
do they progress like skyrim or do you have to buy the points


[8/25/2025 5:45 PM] ursorenda
you get a certain number of points per level to invest into various attributes, the amount of points is governed by your intelligence special


[8/25/2025 5:45 PM] ursorenda
if you wanna peruse, most of it is accurate

Start a new game, if it doesn’t load you to the elevator after you finish making a character that indicates a corrupted install


[8/25/2025 6:01 PM] dragonpalm
when you say "making a character" is that like the appearance or the specials with the dude


[8/25/2025 6:01 PM] ursorenda
Character creation includes choosing special distribution


[8/25/2025 6:02 PM] dragonpalm
ok yeah I didn't get the popups either but when I continued game before seeing your message I got a ton of popups


[8/25/2025 6:02 PM] ursorenda
I would start a new game m8

[8/25/2025 8:03 PM] dragonpalm
Had to go to a thing for a bit


[8/25/2025 8:03 PM] dragonpalm
any particularly recommended fast starts? I know a lot of the game expects you to follow certain paths but idk if it's been rebalanced with that in mind


[8/25/2025 9:07 PM] dragonpalm
Are there any mods options that re-enables regular saving? I know "hardcore survival" but not being able to save is the only thing I hate about it. Having to redo a ton of gameplay because I died on accident will make me quit before any level of difficulty does.


[8/25/2025 9:08 PM] dragonpalm
also my background gave me a gun but no ammo and I can't survive anything :c


[8/25/2025 9:10 PM] corvuscoraxian
Losing hours of progress IS the fun part lol


[8/26/2025 12:50 AM] ursorenda
It’ll do that sometimes. You would just reload that save at the top and choose the same background.


[8/26/2025 12:50 AM] ursorenda
Honestly it’s purely taste. There are leveled areas, so some are more brutal than others


[8/26/2025 12:51 AM] ursorenda
Make survival packs to save whenever or save at chairs my friend.

In the next release it’ll be save by cigarette 🙃

[8/26/2025 12:52 AM] dragonpalm
I tried saving at a chair and it didn't save. The option didn't show up and waiting didn't do it. I also didn't see any special buttons when interacting. This was with multiple chairs.


[8/26/2025 12:55 AM] ursorenda
Were you crouched, and were you in combat?

You won’t be able to save at chairs in either scenario. Survival packs can be used anywhere at any time


[8/26/2025 12:55 AM] dragonpalm
Not for me lol. I hate doing things twice. I don't rewatch shows, I don't reread books, and I don't replay games without mods that drastically change them.


[8/26/2025 12:57 AM] corvuscoraxian
Lol that's some cheery sarcasm on my end. I mean it was my fault, i don't know why but I spent literally two hours of real time without resting nor saving at benches. I laugh now but in that moment I ragequit


[8/26/2025 12:57 AM] dragonpalm
I don't think so? I tried at a chair in the trailer by the vault elevator, I tried at a chair in sanctuary, and I looked at a chair in Concord but I don't think I sat in it


[8/26/2025 12:58 AM] ursorenda
You would just look at the chair and it adds a contextual prompt to save, not sit in em


[8/26/2025 12:58 AM] dragonpalm
Yeah I didn't see that, it just has the F to sit


[8/26/2025 12:59 AM] corvuscoraxian
Save by ciggies!? That's the best thing I've heard since quantum Nuka recipes being dropped


[8/26/2025 1:00 AM] dragonpalm
Is it safe to load the save after fast start teleports you?


[8/26/2025 1:01 AM] ursorenda
Gotcha. Sounds like the perk associated with the chair save didn’t activate. It’s why we’re removing it. You can try adding the new mod in since itll work without patching 

https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/95995

make sure you check the dependencies, it has one for animations.


Yeah that should be safe.

Ooo as i went to get ready to sleep I remembered what I wanted to ask: Does this mean the packs you find or just loose cigars act as saves? Or is it its own thing?


[8/26/2025 1:46 AM] corvuscoraxian
actually I can jus look at the mod. duh


[8/26/2025 1:47 AM] ursorenda
if you add it to an existing save it contains both. Packs of cigs contain 20, cartons contain 20 packs


[8/26/2025 1:48 AM] corvuscoraxian
Woo! i jus read it, and 20? Man why are games always better? Cartons have 10 packs. Price of such is bonkers too depending on state.

(I say all this like I smoke, but i have a lot of smoker buddies so I picked up some knowledge so I'm hopefully not clueless in conversation)

Oh i work at a gas station so as for the price I know that much. Less so on how many come in a pack. Cartons i learned after selling enough of em and having to scan crap up individually because store stopped selling them by carton

You gotta tinker with FallUI on MCM.


[8/26/2025 8:49 AM] tiburse
That is a multi part thing.  Cant do it all together as each UI element has its own scaling.

Under mod manager, User interface, Fall-UI hud, Layout. you will be able to customize each element.


[8/26/2025 8:50 AM] tiburse
can mouseover and scroll wheel or clock on the UI element for finer tuning


[8/26/2025 10:50 AM] dragonpalm
I noticed MCM said "DON'T EDIT BELOW THIS" how hard of a rule is that? For example I wanted to turn off having to heal companions after combat (at least for the beginning because stims are precious). Is that R11 or nah


[8/26/2025 10:51 AM] dragonpalm
*assuming this list uses the Wabbajack rules scheme*


[8/26/2025 10:58 AM] ursorenda
we aren't hitlarian about the settings provided, you can edit them. 

We just don't offer *any* support if you do, and while it doesn't violate any posted rules, I'm gonna be tempted to just boot you from the server if you make us spend time troubleshooting only for us to find out you've editting a setting and failed to tell us. 

Doesn't happen often that adjusting MCM settings causes issues, however. Also one of the features our launcher has is it'll snitch on you if you make any of those changes 🙃


[8/26/2025 10:58 AM] ursorenda
To clarify, I wouldn't boot anyone for that. I would just be *seriously* tempted to


[8/26/2025 11:12 AM] dragonpalm
lol ok, that's kinda the Wabbajack Rule 11 lol. Support is voided if you make changes to the list. Some authors intend for MCM settings to be edited to the user's liking so that one isn't always considered R11


[8/26/2025 11:13 AM] ursorenda
Eventually there will be a clear separation between R11 and non R11 mods in the MCM. For now it's all considered R11, yes.


[8/26/2025 11:15 AM] fir3f7y
Hey odd one cant remember if it was this mod list that had the stupid Resident Evil / zombie mods in, does the list have them in ? or am I thinking of a different mod list


[8/26/2025 11:20 AM] ursorenda
yeah this one uses FallEvil and includes the lickers and paleheads


[8/26/2025 11:22 AM] fir3f7y
Ahh yeah just found them are they critical ? or can they can they be removed ?


[8/26/2025 11:23 AM] ursorenda
Unsure if you can disable them via the MCM, but FallEvil is a required mod


[8/26/2025 11:28 AM] dragonpalm
Is that why Concord is full of zombies that caved my face in?


[8/26/2025 11:31 AM] fir3f7y
Any idea why or mod/s requires it ? It's extraordinarily out of date and seems to be one of the few mods that are overly non-canon


[8/26/2025 11:32 AM] ursorenda
I can’t speak to the specific reason we include it but if there’s an alternative you might suggest we’re all ears. FWIW I’m not a fan of the lickers either. Animations are jarring.

Not all categories are populated


[8/26/2025 11:46 AM] ursorenda
Those arrows on the left are collapsible, if you click it will expand to show the mods within that category. No arrow, no mods.


[8/26/2025 11:46 AM] sleepylei1
tks a lot


[8/26/2025 12:05 PM] fred.pja.school.sucks
Dose this pack have PANPC


[8/26/2025 1:05 PM] nomad5157
No, PANPC is not allowed to be included in wabbjack/collections


[8/26/2025 1:58 PM] corvuscoraxian
I myself love anything horror added. Was looking for something spooky, this was closest could find. (the one I saw years ago that had silent hill references is outdated atm)


[8/26/2025 2:00 PM] fred.pja.school.sucks
How good is the combat ai


[8/26/2025 2:52 PM] corvuscoraxian
pretty good. they hardly miss


[8/26/2025 3:24 PM] punishedmobius
Do II unlock VATS or something? 

its supposed to be Q but I am getting nothing?


[8/26/2025 3:54 PM] corvuscoraxian
VATS is replaced with real time slow


[8/26/2025 3:55 PM] corvuscoraxian
I dont remember how I did it, but unbind the VATS key and try q again.


[8/26/2025 3:56 PM] corvuscoraxian
Or maybe I had to go into the new thing and bind that to q...sorry wish I actually recalled xD


[8/26/2025 3:56 PM] corvuscoraxian
OOO and I remember someone saying something about how some perks don't work with the vats replacement.


[8/26/2025 5:17 PM] ursorenda
it's called VAFS now, and like Corvus said it's a bullet time. Default is G, can be changed in the MCM under gameplay

Hey does the modpack have a leaning mod in it? if not is it compatible with uneducated shooter mod?


[8/26/2025 5:23 PM] ursorenda
we have added uneducated shooter as an optional towards the bottom of MO2's install window


[8/26/2025 5:24 PM] fjayz.
i just saw it thank you


[8/26/2025 5:24 PM] ursorenda
If I had a dollar for every time :p


[8/26/2025 5:24 PM] corvuscoraxian
You could solve world hunger?


[8/26/2025 5:25 PM] ursorenda
I *could* but I'd more liable to start a development studio with the devs :p


[8/26/2025 5:25 PM] corvuscoraxian
Speakin of a lot of money, those of you that do powerball, the jackpot is almost at 1bil. Crazy, saw it while workin last weekend


[8/26/2025 6:44 PM] poppa.guisado
where do i access Unlimited Survival Mode, doesnt seem to be in the mcm


[8/26/2025 6:45 PM] ursorenda
all available MCM options for survival mode are under the survival category. 

If it's not there, it's been removed in the pursuit of stability.


[8/26/2025 6:50 PM] ursorenda
the poor people tax really knows how to entice


[8/26/2025 7:10 PM] corvuscoraxian
I just love gambling. Well not the lotto or machines. Never won anyway. Tables on the other hand- loooove those.


[8/26/2025 7:11 PM] corvuscoraxian
Remember to split your 10's and double down your hard 14-16's. When everyone else at the table is beyond pissed you know you're havin a good time.


[8/26/2025 7:26 PM] dragonpalm
aight how do I add this mf


[8/26/2025 7:27 PM] ursorenda
check the mod page. Has another mod as a req, add both in MO2 by downloading from the nexus and then clicking the "install archive" button at the top left of MO2


[8/26/2025 7:28 PM] dragonpalm
do I need to put them in the same downloads folder that Wabba goes to or somewhere else


[8/26/2025 7:29 PM] ursorenda
nope. you can place them where ever you'd like


[8/26/2025 7:29 PM] ursorenda
Wabba: Installs mods and adjusts settings in a hyper specific way *ala, does the modding for you*

MO2: A Mod Organizer and launcher that Wabba uses to install mods.


[8/26/2025 7:30 PM] ursorenda
what you're doing right now is manually installing a mod. Welcome to the modding life my friend


[8/26/2025 7:30 PM] dragonpalm
right, I've never manually done mods for MO2 or Bethesda games so idk what the reqs are


[8/26/2025 7:31 PM] dragonpalm
I build my own lists for Paradox games and write mods for Minecraft though so I'm not completely dumb to the concepts


[8/26/2025 7:32 PM] dragonpalm
does it matter where the go in the load order?


[8/26/2025 8:08 PM] fred.pja.school.sucks
Beth ini is saving to a weird nonexistent drive


[8/26/2025 8:22 PM] dragonpalm
There are no cigarettes in the entirety of Sanctuary


[8/26/2025 8:22 PM] ursorenda
You'll find them 😂


[8/26/2025 8:23 PM] dragonpalm
I just got sent back to character creation by mole rats because I couldn't find a cigarette


[8/26/2025 8:23 PM] ursorenda
please use the search function I'm a little tired of pointing people towards the fix


[8/26/2025 8:23 PM] ursorenda
survival packs exist


[8/26/2025 8:23 PM] ursorenda
so does the mod explorer (forward slash, the key under backspace key)


[8/26/2025 8:24 PM] dragonpalm
idk what mod explorer is


[8/26/2025 8:24 PM] dragonpalm
and I have no idea where to get survival packs, I haven't been able to start the game yet because pistols are useless and I can't find any way to save


[8/26/2025 8:25 PM] dragonpalm
This is why I just want the ability to F5 back


[8/26/2025 8:25 PM] ursorenda
chem stations are where yo'd craft em


[8/26/2025 8:26 PM] ursorenda
check out the mod explorer and see what you can find out. there's a search function built into it. 

Just be aware it's a lil slow and you will likely have to hit the \ button multiple times for it to open, same with the search function. It's trying to load 800+ mods


[8/26/2025 8:27 PM] ursorenda
there's also a free one inside vault 111, and a carton of cigarettes. Just make sure you deactivate uneducated shooter if you're gonna go in there, there's a known bug that'll shoot you through the floor if you lean inside vault 111


[8/26/2025 8:28 PM] dragonpalm
is uneducated shooter the optional mod? if so I don't have it active


[8/26/2025 8:28 PM] ursorenda
yeah it's an optional. I love it, despite it having some funny bugs like the one I described above


[8/26/2025 8:33 PM] dragonpalm
what am I supposed to be finding in the \ menu


[8/26/2025 8:33 PM] dragonpalm
I don't understand what this menu is


[8/26/2025 8:33 PM] ursorenda
it's an explorer for all of the mods. 

If you're looking for cigarettes to save, try searching for cigarette


[8/26/2025 8:34 PM] dragonpalm
oh it's a cheat menu


[8/26/2025 8:34 PM] dragonpalm
I understand now


[8/26/2025 8:34 PM] ursorenda
I mean yeah. It circumvents the need to hunt down formIDs for items


[8/26/2025 8:38 PM] dragonpalm
I don't understand the cigarette thing


[8/26/2025 8:38 PM] dragonpalm
I have them, how do I use them to save


[8/26/2025 8:38 PM] ursorenda
like any other consumable m8


[8/26/2025 8:38 PM] dragonpalm
they're not in my consumable, they're in junk. Clicking them does nothing


[8/26/2025 8:39 PM] ursorenda
you grabbed the wrong cigs then. The ones that are savable have the cig tag in front of em, IIRC


[8/26/2025 8:39 PM] ursorenda
also.... sorry if this is pedantic m8 but, make sure you've activated the mod in MO2


[8/26/2025 8:40 PM] dragonpalm
I did yeah


[8/26/2025 8:41 PM] ursorenda
check the Mod Explorer again. Maybe trying limiting your search to just Cig. 

To be perfectly frank this should be contextually obvious if you spent any amount of time reading the mod page.


[8/26/2025 8:41 PM] dragonpalm
the mod page has like, nothing on it


[8/26/2025 8:42 PM] ursorenda
it has everything one should need to understand how it works

[8/26/2025 8:46 PM] dragonpalm
I don't have the [Cig] or [CigPack] ones


[8/26/2025 8:47 PM] ursorenda
go back to your MO2 and make sure the pointed to mods are activated in the install window and plugins window


[8/26/2025 8:47 PM] ursorenda

[8/26/2025 8:47 PM] dragonpalm
They are


[8/26/2025 8:51 PM] ursorenda
if they are then they should be there. Just grab a cigarette carton and click it to open it. should produce 10 cigarette packs. if it does, you're in business, click a cig pack to open it for 20 cigarettes


[8/26/2025 9:07 PM] poppa.guisado
whats the difference between survival and very hard with all the survival mods added?


[8/26/2025 9:07 PM] poppa.guisado
besides fast travel and saving


[8/26/2025 9:08 PM] ursorenda
the game malfunctioning and save bloat stacking


[8/26/2025 9:09 PM] ursorenda
you're welcome to try but if you run into any issues my first recommendation will be to revert back to your survival save or start a new game. 

Damage is still realistic and the AI are still accurate and deadly.


[8/26/2025 9:09 PM] ursorenda
same with radiation and conditions


[8/26/2025 9:11 PM] ursorenda
for reference, my very first playthrough was on 0.5.6, a build which had left the difficulty at Very Hard (on accident). I didn't know I was supposed to ahve it on survival, my save made it about 1 day before brahmin started flying across the skyline and it took like 15 minutes to load a save.


[8/26/2025 9:30 PM] punishedmobius
ill give that a try! thanks


[8/26/2025 9:32 PM] fred.pja.school.sucks
Shold thayr only be 622 mods


[8/26/2025 9:33 PM] ursorenda
I might have an old number idk tbh. But it's enough that some patience should be applied when opening the mod explorer


[8/26/2025 9:34 PM] ursorenda
Let me know if that works. 

It *shouldn't*. But if it does, lemme know.


[8/26/2025 9:50 PM] fred.pja.school.sucks

can someoneone help me to set up the hud?


[8/27/2025 9:39 AM] dragonpalm
real question: what are the intended first steps in this pack? Cause the bandits in Concord are absolutely destroying me and I've not been able to figure out how to approach them


[8/27/2025 9:41 AM] dragonpalm
I've already decided I'm going to start over and go for long guns as my first pick, I had switched to handguns cause I thought pistols would be easier to come by but then I remembered pipe rifles exist


[8/27/2025 10:38 AM] sawog
i had to open cheats until i get a proper loot


[8/27/2025 10:38 AM] sawog
it was so hard with no loot, they are just so powerful


[8/27/2025 10:46 AM] dragonpalm
That's why I'm wondering what the intended first steps are. Like, are we supposed to avoid fights until we get stuff, are we meant to start a base first and get established before heading out, or are we just supposed to git gud


[8/27/2025 12:14 PM] patrickjr



[8/27/2025 1:25 PM] tiburse
I mean, I just went and killed/harvested the radstags nearby, built up my starting base a bit, that got me to around 9. Then went west to the farm and down to the diner to kill the 2 chem dealers at the diner then back up to RR from the manhole and over to the raider camp for the farm locket quest, stealth killed that and back to base. Gets you to about 14-17 dependent on what you run into and your int.


[8/27/2025 1:26 PM] dragonpalm
Before going to Concord?


[8/27/2025 1:27 PM] tiburse
Yep


[8/27/2025 1:27 PM] tiburse
All before going there.


[8/27/2025 1:27 PM] tiburse
Thats my normal route tbh.


[8/27/2025 1:28 PM] tiburse
Shoot, Ive cleared most of Lexington without triggering the brotherhood event or the Piper event. Including clearing corvega.


[8/27/2025 1:28 PM] tiburse
I tend to side quest and build lol


[8/27/2025 1:28 PM] dragonpalm
I usually do Concord -> Diner -> BoS Police Station -> Diamond City (obv not in this list)


[8/27/2025 1:29 PM] dragonpalm
and I try to stop by Starlight somewhere in there


[8/27/2025 1:29 PM] tiburse
Heh, Starlight is my current project.


[8/27/2025 1:30 PM] tiburse
Dont like what I nhave done with it so far


[8/27/2025 1:33 PM] dragonpalm
I suck at building, I usually try to just get all the benches down in some manner of not horrible to look at fashion


[8/27/2025 1:34 PM] tiburse
do NOT use scrap all


[8/27/2025 1:34 PM] tiburse
it will bork RIO (the rebuild mod)


[8/27/2025 1:35 PM] dragonpalm
I know lol


[8/27/2025 1:35 PM] tiburse
I learned that the hard way


[8/27/2025 1:35 PM] tiburse
Never modded before this pack.


[8/27/2025 1:36 PM] dragonpalm
iirc scrap all runs a command that ungroups grouped builds and that causes probems for a lot of things


[8/27/2025 1:36 PM] tiburse
Been a nice change of pace. Grant you I did change a few things.


[8/27/2025 1:36 PM] tiburse
that it do


[8/27/2025 1:36 PM] tiburse
Soverign got to hit me with an "I told you so"


[8/27/2025 1:37 PM] dragonpalm
I've played Magnum Opus a few times, it just had it's 7th major update (to Version 8) and it made me want to play Fallout again, but I've played that list three times now and really want a different experience


[8/27/2025 1:39 PM] tiburse
I mean this one will def give you that haha


[8/27/2025 1:40 PM] dragonpalm
Yeah MO is a power fantast list that simply seeks to add a lot of fun and reasonably balanced content to the game (as well as a fresh coat of paint)


[8/27/2025 1:41 PM] dragonpalm
Same with Lively's Skyrim list Tempus Maledictum


[8/27/2025 1:44 PM] tiburse
Right on, I wanted something a bit more gritty. Found this one and a close friend is super into stalker so when I found this was a mix I was like aight bet.


[8/27/2025 1:44 PM] tiburse
Grant you Ive only ever played vanilla 4


[8/27/2025 1:55 PM] tiburse

Gonna try to make something mased on that


[8/27/2025 2:07 PM] corvuscoraxian
Don't know how I managed but if ya treat it like everything is a threat and go extra careful they die just as easy as you do with gunfire. Hit & run tactics early on, oh take dogmeat with ya. Free aggro in pup form. Handguns are a great way to go as well as rifles. Best way I've found so far is to ignore the story. Survive naturally as it comes to you and if you happen to progress story woohoo!


[8/27/2025 2:10 PM] corvuscoraxian
Grenades are pretty bonkers too.


[8/27/2025 2:23 PM] dragonpalm
Yeah I've tried stealthing in from every angle I can lol. There's a horde of zombies and a ton of bandits, I can only run for like 3 seconds so they always catch and swarm me. A couple times I got lucky and the zombies and bandits all killed each other, but one chick with a flamethrower just refuses to go down, and she runs way faster than I do.


[8/27/2025 2:24 PM] tiburse
Try to pop her with a Molotov.


[8/27/2025 2:24 PM] tiburse
It has a fear effect that will cause enemys to drop weapons.


[8/27/2025 2:24 PM] tiburse
Love using that trick on the packs of gunners that roam the wastes.


[8/27/2025 2:25 PM] tiburse
Either that or I just pop them with the M72 long before they even know Im there


[8/27/2025 2:25 PM] corvuscoraxian
waat. Zombies are the easiest thing to handle so far. Idk how they swarm, usually good placement avoids that. Using terrain to advantage if possible as well. Flamethrowers are a nightmare so ya got me there.


[8/27/2025 2:25 PM] corvuscoraxian
Plus if there's a horde of zombies & bandits they should attack eachother


[8/27/2025 2:25 PM] dragonpalm
yeah I don't have weapons or gear lol, I'm heading to Concord fresh out of the vault. I hit level 2 killing some bugs and rats


[8/27/2025 2:25 PM] corvuscoraxian
ooooh yeah nah


[8/27/2025 2:26 PM] dragonpalm
They only sometimes do, sometimes the zombies don't wake up and the bandits are just chillin


[8/27/2025 2:26 PM] corvuscoraxian
and melee is not the way to go either


[8/27/2025 2:26 PM] dragonpalm
yeah I don't do melee in FO4


[8/27/2025 2:27 PM] tiburse
They are a nightmare even at 60. (furthest leveled save long lost at this point)


[8/27/2025 2:27 PM] dragonpalm
Tonight I think I'm gonna start a new character and do a perception/int build and do the hunter background for the rifle


[8/27/2025 2:27 PM] tiburse
did you go back into the vault for extra xp?


[8/27/2025 2:27 PM] corvuscoraxian
so def want to pick up something but I cannot recall where to go first. I mean there's some nades in the trash bin at sanctuary (near bridge) maybe even a loose gun somewhere around rocket


[8/27/2025 2:27 PM] dragonpalm
nope


[8/27/2025 2:27 PM] corvuscoraxian
I chose a background with a starting weapon so xD


[8/27/2025 2:28 PM] corvuscoraxian
actually wait i was in same boat. my starting weapon was a melee


[8/27/2025 2:28 PM] dragonpalm
Yeah I've been picking background that have weapons too, but the weapon only has like 7 bullets and that doesn't go very far against 10 bandits and 20 zombies


[8/27/2025 2:28 PM] corvuscoraxian
idk, build runs around animal companion perks


[8/27/2025 2:29 PM] corvuscoraxian
aggro zombies & bandits from distance maybe?


[8/27/2025 2:29 PM] corvuscoraxian
stir the nest per say


[8/27/2025 2:29 PM] dragonpalm
yeah tried all that lol


[8/27/2025 2:29 PM] corvuscoraxian
well darn


[8/27/2025 2:30 PM] corvuscoraxian
I guess I got lucky, while there was a crap load of bandits I only had like..5 zombies


[8/27/2025 2:31 PM] dragonpalm
Yeah on mine there's a bunch of bandits and a bunch of zombies, and a giant green zombie thing crawling around on all fours


[8/27/2025 2:31 PM] corvuscoraxian
Hell even the deathclaw got aggrod on the Mr.Handy at the back end which wouldn't die.


[8/27/2025 2:31 PM] corvuscoraxian
OOO the lickers


[8/27/2025 2:31 PM] corvuscoraxian
Unfortunate


[8/27/2025 2:32 PM] dragonpalm
the flamethrower lady takes out the green lad pretty easy

Make a suggestion and I will put in a tram cart that you can build in


[8/27/2025 4:05 PM] nomad5157
Thank you for the boosts ❤️🫶

Define soon


[8/27/2025 4:31 PM] ursorenda
what are you trying to accomplish


[8/27/2025 4:32 PM] ursorenda
we have a policy against providing specific dates if we aren't exceptionally certain we can acheive them. Please remember that we all have lives and jobs, and this is stuff we do in our free time.


[8/27/2025 4:34 PM] ursorenda
your first steps should be carefully acquiring gear. 

My recomendation is to head to the satelite array north east of sanctuary. Less raiders but decent loot. I'd then head west of vault 111. Those two encounters should net you enough gear. If they don't, try the opening encounters of the Enclave quest, follow the river below vault 111 to the west


[8/27/2025 4:35 PM] dragonpalm
I'm not the kind of person to get mad if a date isn't adhered to. I get what ya mean though. I'm asking cause if it's gonna be like, this week, I will probably wait before playing again. If it's gonna be a couple months then I won't bother waiting


[8/27/2025 4:36 PM] ursorenda
the update won't stop the concord raiders from being a horribly difficult encounter :p


[8/27/2025 4:37 PM] dragonpalm
I'm more concerned about it being save safe lol


[8/27/2025 4:39 PM] dragonpalm
I'm not wanting the update for the Concord fight, just to be on the hopefully better version of the list. I don't know what better means but I expect the amazing work y'all do to be worth it


[8/27/2025 4:39 PM] ursorenda
it's not :p

Or at least I don't believe it is, look to the announcement for that info. 

But we're adding a shite load of guns and armor to the LL so I can't imagine it would be


[8/27/2025 4:40 PM] dragonpalm
So any guestimate as to what soon means? Y'all can DM it to me if y'all are worried about other people lol


[8/27/2025 4:42 PM] ursorenda
I only give special treatment to those on my beta testing team and frequent contributors to the modpack (I consider filing bug reports to be contributions :p)

You're a chill dude but, sorry, no.


[8/27/2025 4:42 PM] ursorenda
when the devs are ready they'll announce it in the announcements channel

there are two in the trash can just before the sanctuary bridge :p


[8/27/2025 4:45 PM] ursorenda
pro tip, it randomizes the mods attached. If you're pride can handle it, you can reload that save when you pop up out the elevator as many times as you need till you get the configuration you want (I do that whenever it spits out a short barrel config, hate those)


[8/27/2025 4:46 PM] dragonpalm
Well I wasn't planning on doing that but *now that I know*

you will, occasionally, need to wait in order for us to get to your ticket. This is all volunteer work, we don't get paid to do this.

This is your first warning. If you need help, create a support ticket. Do not *also* make a post in general chat about your issue. 

I've provided a possible solution on your support ticket.


[8/27/2025 4:55 PM] nomad5157
The small fixes that we are working on…saving, rad changes etc are save safe that’s about it for now


[8/27/2025 4:59 PM] ursorenda
@DragonPalm there's your answer :p

This rifle I got is really pulling its weight


[8/27/2025 10:19 PM] ursorenda
Distance goes a long way when your enemies spam grenades and lethal aim


[8/27/2025 10:19 PM] ursorenda
Shotguns also absolutely blast people now, though missing your shot can mean death


[8/28/2025 12:41 AM] blursedbucket
Is there some kind of Selective fire mode im unaware of


[8/28/2025 12:41 AM] blursedbucket
because my gatling laser is stuck in semi-auto for a while, but it was automatic, like a normal gatling before


[8/28/2025 12:41 AM] blursedbucket
havent changed its modifications at all


[8/28/2025 12:42 AM] creamycoolbro
this has prob been addressed but downloading through Wabbajack, one of the mods is unavailable and stops the install process, any workaround?


[8/28/2025 12:42 AM] creamycoolbro
i manually downloaded and moved the 10 that require it but ones nexus page is purged

there's also Shift H but that is intended for troubleshooting purposes only, AFAIK


[8/28/2025 2:13 AM] blursedbucket
Yeah, I now know what happened. I renamed a weapon in workbench and hit the U key while typing whatever it was, without realising that it was triggering even through the workbench UI


[8/28/2025 2:53 AM] gibonez
Is it normal for the game to just freeze up every few seconds


[8/28/2025 3:38 AM] tiburse
Morning all


[8/28/2025 3:39 AM] tiburse
I have not ran into this. Did you make sure to set your pagefile to 16gb on the drive the install is on?


[8/28/2025 3:39 AM] gibonez
Page file is like 40 gigs


[8/28/2025 3:40 AM] gibonez
It didn't crash it just would freeze up for a second or two then go back to normal


[8/28/2025 3:41 AM] tiburse
Try backing that down to 16gb. Larger page files shave always had issues with beth games. Also make sure it is set on the drive that Anlomoly is installed on. 

What about the other system specs, gpu, ram, gpu. All that. Hard to tell whats going on until we start tracing.


[8/28/2025 3:41 AM] tiburse
Physical layer is the easiest to start  with.


[8/28/2025 3:42 AM] gibonez
Got you


[8/28/2025 3:42 AM] gibonez
I'm pretty good on the rest 3080 card, ryzen 7 of some kind but only 16 gigs of ram I should get more


[8/28/2025 3:48 AM] tiburse
Im running on 32 GB on both laptop and desktop. That might be the issue. Check your system monitor and see if anything is getting maxed out on memory while running. For RAM and VRAM.


[8/28/2025 3:48 AM] tiburse
Also on a 4060(laptop) and 6900xt(desktop)


[8/28/2025 3:49 AM] tiburse
If it is maxing anything that it shouldnt be I would adjust game settings in bethpie


[8/28/2025 3:50 AM] tiburse
Lower the godrays to low (they still look good), up grass to 55-60, and turn off lens flair


[8/28/2025 3:51 AM] tiburse
I would also drop shadows from 2048 to 1024.


[8/28/2025 3:54 AM] tiburse
Also do not mind my scatterbrain with this, just trying go cover as much as I can as I am also working and cleaning my house IRL at the same time.


[8/28/2025 5:10 AM] patrickjr
No worries:)


[8/28/2025 6:53 AM] dragonpalm
Oh I forgot about the page file. I haven't had any problems yet but I do also have 48gb of RAM


[8/28/2025 7:13 AM] tiburse
Thats good to know, I was gonna test that by moving to 64gb on my desktop


[8/28/2025 7:14 AM] dragonpalm
Question: is there a way to fast travel or is it wholesale disabled? (Not saying I need to fast travel, just curious)


[8/28/2025 7:28 AM] tiburse
You have the sewer workshop network, the APC, and vertibird (once you get far enough in the quests). Other than that you cant just click and go like the default fast travel system.


[8/28/2025 7:37 AM] dragonpalm
Oh I didn't think about the sewers


[8/28/2025 7:38 AM] dragonpalm
I'm avoiding living there cause I always live there but they would be good for fast travel


[8/28/2025 8:36 AM] tiburse
I just hooked up power and lights and left it at that


[8/28/2025 8:36 AM] tiburse
I use it mostly as a dump hub for cleaning out areas


[8/28/2025 8:37 AM] tiburse
then just use the packaging terminal when done with an area and take it back to main base


[8/28/2025 8:42 AM] yami_ger
I think i use it beside apc as nice travel


[8/28/2025 8:43 AM] tiburse
I can see that. Have migrated away from my normal red rocket build and decided to put the sanc build on hold. Moved to Starlight and almost ready to move the people. The APC parks right out front here. Ive taken a big liking to that mod as well. I just wish it had a packing terminal lol


[8/28/2025 9:31 AM] dragonpalm
packaging terminal? that sounds handy


[8/28/2025 9:32 AM] dragonpalm
oh speaking of which where do I find these journals to craft the blueprints for crafting stations?


[8/28/2025 9:32 AM] dragonpalm
I realize I started with the knowledge to make ammo for my gun but not the knowledge to make the bench to make the ammo for my gun


[8/28/2025 9:37 AM] tiburse
look at the piles of books for overdue books out in the world and you can find them on enemys then craft them at the utility workbench iirc


[8/28/2025 9:37 AM] dragonpalm
cool cool


[8/28/2025 9:38 AM] dragonpalm

May just be an issue with the older ones

you should still set one up, but you can settle for a smaller one. Min 16gb is my rec

How does VATS work in this pack. It says that it's available in the keybinds but it does not work. Is it locked behind a perk?


[8/28/2025 12:29 PM] ursorenda
we use VAFs


[8/28/2025 12:29 PM] ursorenda
default key is G


[8/28/2025 12:29 PM] ursorenda
VATs is completely unavailable and cannot be reactivated


[8/28/2025 12:30 PM] gryt
alright. In that case I might just bind VAFs to q to remember easily


[8/28/2025 12:30 PM] ursorenda
the keybind is inside the MCM under the gameplay category


[8/28/2025 12:30 PM] blursedbucket
haven't had a single issue with my new Ryzen 7 9800x3d


[8/28/2025 12:30 PM] ursorenda
though.... if you want to use the Lean mod (uneducated shooter) you may want to find a different key


[8/28/2025 12:31 PM] gryt
Is the lean mod already in the pack or is that something I have to manually add?


[8/28/2025 12:31 PM] ursorenda
the newer, more powerful ones can truck through. it's the somewhat older gen ones that struggle


[8/28/2025 12:31 PM] ursorenda
optionals section of MO2 at the bottom


[8/28/2025 12:31 PM] blursedbucket
ah yeah those older ones a bit weak


[8/28/2025 12:31 PM] blursedbucket
I remember when the FX series was straight up better than intel for gaming


[8/28/2025 12:32 PM] blursedbucket
mid to late 2000s, those were some days lol


[8/28/2025 12:39 PM] gryt
To enable the Uneducated shooter mod. Do I have to do anything other than pressing the enable button?


[8/28/2025 12:41 PM] blursedbucket
remember to activate after leaving the Vault, and yes, you may have to bind keys in MCM


[8/28/2025 1:05 PM] ursorenda
you have to configure the keybinds


[8/28/2025 1:05 PM] ursorenda
in the mcm


[8/28/2025 1:06 PM] gryt
Yes I have done that now. This absolutely helps a bit with the difficulty


[8/28/2025 1:19 PM] tiburse
Whatis the keybind for holding breath when aiming


[8/28/2025 1:21 PM] dragonpalm
speaking of, some of the perks specifically affects VATs. Has their functionality been adjusted for VAFs or should we just avoid those perks?


[8/28/2025 1:22 PM] dragonpalm
(I do not use VATs or VAFs, haven't since ADS was introduced in New Vegas)


[8/28/2025 1:26 PM] ursorenda
They're largely applicable in the same way, VAFs uses the same keywords that VATs does it just changes the functionality. YMMV for things like accuracy but damage and AP consumption apply directly


[8/28/2025 1:26 PM] dragonpalm
cool cool


[8/28/2025 1:27 PM] ursorenda
I remember adding in mods that did ADS in fo3, great times lmfao


[8/28/2025 1:27 PM] dragonpalm
I also think I'm gonna turn uneducated shooter on, I'm finding myself really pining for cover and having to expose my jiblits to shoot people is not ideal


[8/28/2025 1:28 PM] dragonpalm
I was still a console pleb when FO3 came out lol


[8/28/2025 1:29 PM] ursorenda
just remember that FO4 isn't exactly the best at weaving shots, don't try to shoot between wrecked cars. 

Also, snap your lean, the combat AI works very similarly to elden ring's


[8/28/2025 1:30 PM] dragonpalm
I shouldn't say that, I *was* playing PC games, but I was playing Runescape, World of Warcraft, and Battlefield 2


[8/28/2025 1:30 PM] dragonpalm
pretty much everything else was on xbox


[8/28/2025 1:31 PM] dragonpalm
I have not played Elden Ring, but I am aware that collision boxes of many things extend a good deal beyond their models


[8/28/2025 1:31 PM] ursorenda
to put it simply, it retains your position in it's decision making process


[8/28/2025 1:31 PM] ursorenda
i'm not sure how but if you stay leaned they know exactly where to shoot


[8/28/2025 1:32 PM] ursorenda
if you snap lean, they aim where your head *would* be when you pop out of cover


[8/28/2025 1:32 PM] punishedmobius
@The Sovereign I have to question the ammo economy choices.

Like there is low ammo and then there is NO ammo.


[8/28/2025 1:32 PM] ursorenda
use the scrounger perk under lockpicking


[8/28/2025 1:33 PM] dragonpalm
I've found plenty of ammo
none of it the right bleeping kind though


[8/28/2025 1:33 PM] dragonpalm
automod slapped me, I cri


[8/28/2025 1:34 PM] ursorenda
until we trim the totally amount of available ammo types and fine tune ammo acquisition the loop is:

Find ammo, use it as collateral trade for the ammo type you need. 

It works *perfectly fine* if you play that way, and we aren't at a position to change the loop, yet.


[8/28/2025 1:34 PM] punishedmobius
also I don't get why all the best lists fucking insists on removing vats? the fucking core iconic feature of the series lol... I get it. but Also not at all lol.

I can use that perk. But it seems I HAVE to use that perk? you get me?

Also if I put less than 3 strenghth i cant even move with the shit on myu back


[8/28/2025 1:34 PM] punishedmobius
idk the balance is way to front fucked


[8/28/2025 1:34 PM] punishedmobius
im sure you can build out of it


[8/28/2025 1:35 PM] punishedmobius
but I feel locked in instead of free to experimentsd


[8/28/2025 1:35 PM] ursorenda
yes


[8/28/2025 1:35 PM] ursorenda
this modpack is not designed to be an omage to vanilla fallout


[8/28/2025 1:35 PM] ursorenda
it is designed to be punishing and require a lot of front loaded effort to become powerful. Kind of like stalker.


[8/28/2025 1:35 PM] punishedmobius
I know that BUT it is built on fallout 4


[8/28/2025 1:35 PM] punishedmobius

fun fact, we actually have a server member who did exactly that, FWIW. He's a dev now


[8/28/2025 1:37 PM] ursorenda

ok well to me it wasnt a very good one lol

you're more than entitled to your opinion on his counter point. Just be courteous in your disagreement


[8/28/2025 1:38 PM] dragonpalm
I just think it's a bit silly to download a modlist and then complain that it isn't vanilla


[8/28/2025 1:38 PM] ursorenda
it's allowed


[8/28/2025 1:38 PM] punishedmobius
I DO want to learn this system its I am just pointing out how my stealth build with less than 3 strength was over encumbered oout the gate?


[8/28/2025 1:39 PM] punishedmobius
so the whole build doesnt matter if I HAVE to dump some strenght


[8/28/2025 1:39 PM] ursorenda
that is a bug, and I agree that would be frustrating. Go into the MCM and adjust the survival options to not adjust total carryweight


[8/28/2025 1:39 PM] punishedmobius

[8/28/2025 1:42 PM] ursorenda
I will let you know, stealth has a very punishing curve in our modpack. 

Truth be told it needs fine tuning, still. You won't see much until you invest a lot of attribute points into sneak


[8/28/2025 1:42 PM] ursorenda
and then once you hit 100 sneak it's like classic vanilla where you can be right in front of em and they wont see you


[8/28/2025 1:43 PM] ursorenda
right now the absolute most effective strat isn't stealth so much as it's distance


[8/28/2025 1:43 PM] punishedmobius
on one hand I get the challenge. IT IS why I am here.

But you have skyrim people locking themselves out of even the mod menus on purpose lol

Its just when the brushes against actual human player utility ability. it becomes a problem (to me) 

like Disabling god mode command lol. I just wanted to see something real quick and I cant even do that mch


[8/28/2025 1:44 PM] ursorenda

[8/28/2025 1:45 PM] ursorenda
to be honest it was disabled because we'd get people who would TGM through half the game then complain that it was too easy on the later half


[8/28/2025 1:45 PM] ursorenda
that's less the case now but good luck convincing the devs to change it back.

[8/28/2025 1:49 PM] punishedmobius
was that meant to crash my game lol


[8/28/2025 1:49 PM] punishedmobius
becasuse it did lol

no


[8/28/2025 1:50 PM] ursorenda
This mod pack is designed *largely* (it isn't perfected or tuned exactly) to be like Stalker. 

You're reliant on your aim, decision making, and preparation even when you ahve the best armor and weapons. *And* you can still die at any moment once you have all of that. 

kinda like elden ring, where people would complain that it's too hard but then it would come to light: "oh you're just doing the same thing over and over expecting it to work. try this cheesy strat"

You can't complain about a game being hard when the solutions are provided. 

I'll give you an example: There was a raider who would *not* leave a room. This raider has an RPG. This raider pushed my shit in like a horny san fransciscan. 

Do I continue to run in over and over? Fuck no, I chuck a nade in there after the 5th time and laugh at the concept of a grenade exploding that close to an RPG.


[8/28/2025 1:50 PM] ursorenda
it can. it's loading 800+ mods. Shouldn't be consistent though


[8/28/2025 1:52 PM] punishedmobius
So thats FO4s Additemmenu Nice


[8/28/2025 1:52 PM] punishedmobius
I swear i did read the FAQ lol


[8/28/2025 1:54 PM] ursorenda
like an adv version. You can search by keyword. so if you want to see all the different types of 20mm ammo, you can search for 20mm. 

If you wanna see all the different things that work with the MK18, you can search for that and it'll show you all the mods, all the ammo types, all the variations of that gun

[8/28/2025 1:57 PM] punishedmobius
is there any MCM option to sort of make enemies a bit less accurate?


[8/28/2025 1:57 PM] ursorenda
nope!


[8/28/2025 1:57 PM] punishedmobius
woould that mod work in this list even?


[8/28/2025 1:57 PM] ursorenda
that's a very finnicky and hard to tune file on the backend

FYI carlbot doesn't like links

[8/28/2025 1:58 PM] ursorenda
I keep putting off configuring it to require mod approval vs auto delete and throwing the prisoner role onto your profile.

you're welcome to try it. It will conflict with the mod I linked above, most likely

[8/28/2025 2:02 PM] dragonpalm
idk what Mantella is


[8/28/2025 2:02 PM] punishedmobius
I managed to hit a sweet spot in FNV where usually the first spray usaully hits around my feet like an action movie or something


[8/28/2025 2:02 PM] dragonpalm
I've not had too much issue with enemy accuracy but I am staying VERY far away. I've been domed a few times when they pop around a corner on me though


[8/28/2025 2:03 PM] dragonpalm
I will say, I mildly regret taking Four Eyes because I can't use NVGs now. I was hoping any eyewear would count but nope


[8/28/2025 2:03 PM] ursorenda
nothing beats a mini nuke doormat 😛


[8/28/2025 2:03 PM] ursorenda
yup. and it's suprisingly difficult to reclassify NVGs as "glasses" in the eyes of the perk


[8/28/2025 2:04 PM] dragonpalm
Mod suggestion (?) a way to eventually get change/get rid of traits (or remove the negative consequences)


[8/28/2025 2:04 PM] dragonpalm
would want it to be something only achievable later on ofc


[8/28/2025 2:05 PM] punishedmobius
You basically run an AI LLM chatbot through the app and it has the NPCs talk. The program pushes the dialogue through the game and uses the in game voice synth.


[8/28/2025 2:06 PM] dragonpalm
oh, eh


[8/28/2025 2:06 PM] punishedmobius
so now NPCs are as smart as GPT lol


[8/28/2025 2:06 PM] punishedmobius
as far as yappping


[8/28/2025 2:06 PM] dragonpalm
The idea is cool but ChatGPT isn't there yet


[8/28/2025 2:06 PM] ursorenda
mantella also themes them


[8/28/2025 2:06 PM] punishedmobius
Claude is! (just my opinion)


[8/28/2025 2:06 PM] ursorenda
it gets buggy when we already have a number of systems adding and removing perks


[8/28/2025 2:07 PM] punishedmobius
I just don't imagine having much to say to Fallout NPCs lol.

Sure does suck tooday lol


[8/28/2025 2:07 PM] dragonpalm
I could see each perk having a "cured" variant that's just the same perk minus the negative. Maybe a questline with the mutant doctor guy and the FEV virus, it can allow you to change one of your traits into the "cured" variant


[8/28/2025 2:08 PM] ursorenda
hence why I want to tune my own version. It needs to have static pointers for certain NPCs


[8/28/2025 2:09 PM] ursorenda
we might be able to make something like that later down the line. drop a suggestion here https://discord.com/channels/1113971680419782666/1364033035678384169

whats up with a "bop bop bop" hitting me whenever raditation is involved?


[8/28/2025 3:49 PM] punishedmobius
like a radroach comes through fround


[8/28/2025 3:49 PM] punishedmobius
and its hitting me before it even exists on screen


[8/28/2025 3:49 PM] punishedmobius
and a radiated ghoul did it to me behind a closed door


[8/28/2025 4:06 PM] punishedmobius
Went 4 levels without realizing i can upgrade skills now lol


[8/28/2025 4:24 PM] ursorenda
radiation is deadly man idk what to tell you. It's not designed to be "okay" to be exposed to radiation


[8/28/2025 4:26 PM] punishedmobius
it does an effect where it like physically hits me? its fine with the ghoul but the rad roaches were hitting me before they even poppedout of ground


[8/28/2025 4:30 PM] ursorenda
yeah RADs now cause physical damage. 

Lets not do the dance of trading expressions about what is and isn't fair, get some gear that protects from RAD damage and you'll be fine lmfao


[8/28/2025 4:40 PM] dragonpalm
how do I get a compass/minimap on my screen


[8/28/2025 4:41 PM] ursorenda
F2 is the default keybind to hide them, try that to unhide them

thanks


[8/28/2025 4:57 PM] dragonpalm
bruh the raiders are shooting my gun out of my hands now


[8/28/2025 4:57 PM] ursorenda
That's what happens when your arms lose all of their limb health lol


[8/28/2025 4:57 PM] ursorenda
if you have a handgun you can get away with one arm being lost but with rifles and longarms you need both hands


[8/28/2025 4:59 PM] ursorenda
if you wanna contest it I require one video of you firing a rifle after having at least a .45 shot into your arm 🙃 

(disclaimer, don't do that please)


[8/28/2025 4:59 PM] dragonpalm
I've only got a .40 at my desk anyways 😛


[8/28/2025 5:00 PM] dragonpalm
I do wanna contest me not being able to find these heckin raiders I just killed though


[8/28/2025 5:00 PM] dragonpalm
I want their loot 😭


[8/28/2025 5:01 PM] ursorenda
I have that problem all the time. The only real solution is finding thermal vision, since it highlights downed enemies in blue

for sure, i did thats my bad


[8/28/2025 7:35 PM] sis783
hello thinking about installing anomaly. Wanted to ask the community a few questions. Many large modlists are not friendly with adding additional mods, i assume its the same for anomaly? Does anomaly use the current version of fallout 4 or does it do a rollback to a previous version?


[8/28/2025 7:40 PM] dragonpalm
Not sure if I'm bugged but I'm continuously getting radiation poisoning. I cure it, wait around for the debuff to wear off, the immediately get poisoned again. I'm not even in an irradiated area.


[8/28/2025 7:40 PM] ursorenda
in order:

yes but no, it depends entirely on the mod. We use alternatives to many popular mods in the name of stability

No, we use a downgrader. It is automatically applied with no need to downgrade manually


[8/28/2025 7:41 PM] ursorenda
what are your IRA levels at? (Use the Radboy item in your med inventory)


[8/28/2025 7:42 PM] dragonpalm
SAFE // 1 / 1000.0

[8/28/2025 7:43 PM] sis783
hm ok thank you. i really want a hardcore survival experience but theres a few mods i want to use that require the current version of the game to run. any suggestions as to other modpacks that might work as a good jumping off point?


[8/28/2025 7:43 PM] dragonpalm
uhh 3 I think


[8/28/2025 7:43 PM] ursorenda
I couldn't tell you tbh. almost all hardcore based modpacks are going to downgrade.'


[8/28/2025 7:44 PM] dragonpalm
almost all modlists period will downgrade


[8/28/2025 7:44 PM] ursorenda
you have severe RAD exposure, you would want to treat those at a doctor or use Mutaway. 

We're changing the Ca-DTPA to cure both IRAs and RADs in the future, but generally speaking anything above one bar is considered lethal


[8/28/2025 7:44 PM] dragonpalm
at least Wabbajack ones


[8/28/2025 7:45 PM] dragonpalm
ah


[8/28/2025 7:45 PM] ursorenda
trade off will be the Ca-DTPA will no longer cure rad poisoning


[8/28/2025 7:45 PM] ursorenda
we're making another item do that, TBD at a later time

I can't even get out of Sanctuary without racking up 3 bars somehow lol. 

I am treating this like a tutorial run that it is but none of this is listed anywhere but the discord here?

At least I have a reason to Help Preston and Sanctuary since having a doctor actually matters lol

that's install corruption, you would reinstall to fix that

[8/28/2025 9:44 PM] ursorenda
Those are RADs. We use Damn Apocalypse which makes radiation much deadlier. 

As stated many times on this discord, radiation is intended to be deadly. All sources of radiation. Like in real life, it'll kill you dead if you don't respect it's threat.


[8/28/2025 9:45 PM] ursorenda
You know... I wrote a user guide (even themed it like a stalker was telling it to you) 

But I'm not confident it would help like.... 90% of users by virtue of them never actually reading it. 

It's like 40% done because the decision was made to make it significantly shorter and more compartmentalized, then integrate it to our website. If you'd like I'll shoot you the link


[8/28/2025 9:47 PM] ursorenda

You can install the steam version wherever you'd like


[8/29/2025 12:35 AM] .halfbaked
Huh, ok. It’s just. I have installed it there but wabbajack keeps hitting me with this error. wabbajack cannot start installation path does not exist wabbajack modlist pack does not exist


[8/29/2025 12:36 AM] .halfbaked
I had it working on my other ssd but it wasn’t running too well on there so I wanted to move it to my other ssd. Did a clean install and everything


[8/29/2025 12:37 AM] ursorenda
I would recommend putting it outside of your root drive folder. 

You would also want to setup exclusions for the download and install folders in windows defender


[8/29/2025 12:38 AM] .halfbaked
Thank you, I know all of those steps. Like I said, had it working on my other ssd. Don’t think it could handle it though cause it kept freezing to load textures in


[8/29/2025 12:38 AM] .halfbaked
So there’s no way to get it to work on the root drive? Damn, guess I’ll have to buy a new ssd then


[8/29/2025 12:39 AM] ursorenda
it can work on the root drive. I just wouldn't install it inside program files.


[8/29/2025 12:39 AM] ursorenda
steam or wabba

this with Horizon would go so hard


[8/29/2025 10:52 AM] yakucca
this modpack plays well with full or some parts of horizon mod?


[8/29/2025 10:57 AM] ursorenda
probably not


[8/29/2025 12:24 PM] dragonpalm
what is this horizon mod people keep wanting


[8/29/2025 12:32 PM] ursorenda
gigantic overhaul. uses some very custom script backends to accomplish stuff the CK engine can't. 

It's not perfect, has loads of bugs. But I mean, despite that it's very impressive. In many places, antithetical to our modpack's goal, but in many others they do stuff we'd like to make custom. For example, the schematics nomad was describing yesterday in the hangout


[8/29/2025 12:32 PM] ursorenda
horizon does a version of that.


[8/29/2025 2:41 PM] cartjon1
Hey all 🙂 Anyone know why wabbajack keeps saying "While downloading FAnomaly|System.IO.InvalidDataException: Bad response for part request for part 22" and crashing? is this something dumb from my end?


[8/29/2025 2:42 PM] nomad5157
its an issue with the download we are working on fixing now


[8/29/2025 2:42 PM] cartjon1
Ahhhh I see. Thanks so much!


[8/29/2025 3:32 PM] snuggles02x
So is there a modlist for this?


[8/29/2025 3:32 PM] snuggles02x
Is that what the horizon modlist is on wabbajack?


[8/29/2025 3:38 PM] ursorenda
I'm sure if you google'd it you could find a modpack that uses it. It's a mod

Hi all, I


[8/29/2025 5:53 PM] tiburse
Thanks, still learning all the mods in this pack. Mostly been focused on putting together settlement mods.


[8/29/2025 5:54 PM] cartjon1
I'm able to download all but 3 mods through wabbajack. Fallout anomaly huds and the enbseries and the "Main mod". How do I manually find these? I see one is a google drive file but I cannot find it


[8/29/2025 5:54 PM] Deleted User
Eastern operator (main mod) is down


[8/29/2025 5:55 PM] Deleted User
The other two usually when wabbajack fails to download you have the option for it to pop up on Google the missing archives and just click those the huds and enb are commonly like this though


[8/29/2025 5:56 PM] cartjon1
Okay cool. Could you potentially hook me up with the zip file for the main mod? Or will it come back up in a bit?


[8/29/2025 5:56 PM] Deleted User
It was deleted


[8/29/2025 5:57 PM] Deleted User
I dont have the file but usually what happens is the modlist main person edits on wabbajack the thing out so ive just been waiting

Oh you're saying the pack isn't playable I see

[8/29/2025 5:58 PM] dragonpalm

[8/29/2025 5:58 PM] cartjon1
Fallout anomaly HUDS, Main mod, enbseries_fallout_4


[8/29/2025 5:58 PM] cartjon1
I have a screenshot of my logs showing the 3 missing on wabbajack but it will not let me post a photo here

Eastern operator it was deleted, the mod author went too east and no human can operate accurately in the ocean


[8/29/2025 6:00 PM] cartjon1
I did find the website for the enbseries and have the file for that now!


[8/29/2025 6:00 PM] cartjon1
Just two left haha


[8/29/2025 6:00 PM] dragonpalm

Don’t do that, you can get our modpack kicked off wabbajack


[8/29/2025 6:12 PM] cartjon1
Well dang, wabbajack will not install the pack without those two


[8/29/2025 6:13 PM] ursorenda
Two things:

when you have an issue, please check the support forum first, and post there if you can’t find a solution to your issue

And here is the file you need. It’s the archive download link:

https://discord.com/channels/1113971680419782666/1410038033218273381/1410064573196668978

Ahh that's a great lesson in that. Will abide from now on. Thank you very much


[8/29/2025 6:14 PM] ursorenda
For the HUD file click on show archive, that should produce an html page with the gdrive link


[8/29/2025 6:15 PM] ursorenda
If it didn’t let me know. *that* file can be shared with no issue since it was made by our devs and isn’t hosted on the nexus

[8/29/2025 6:26 PM] dragonpalm
If someone can get me the download URL from the Wabbajack "show archive" I'll replace the HUDs file with the link, because you should never trust loose files from strangers on the internet

Feather-Footed doesn't seem to work, I just triggered a mine


[8/29/2025 7:28 PM] ursorenda
…. By that logic you shouldn’t download the wabba file, considering it has complete read/write access 😂

[8/30/2025 3:33 AM] gibonez
Got a simple question is it intended to drain ap when crouch walking? And any way for me to revert to regular saving


[8/30/2025 3:50 AM] ursorenda
yes, no


[8/30/2025 3:50 AM] ursorenda
chair saves or survival packs


[8/30/2025 3:51 AM] ursorenda
it is hard pathed, you would not be able to use menu saves. we do this for stability reasons


[8/30/2025 4:20 AM] gibonez
Dang alright guess I'm saving at all the chairs


[8/30/2025 4:20 AM] gibonez
Just in case


[8/30/2025 4:21 AM] ursorenda
Just remember, the more you save the more you save bloat. We minimized it as much as possible, but CK makes it impossible to avoid


[8/30/2025 4:32 AM] gibonez
Got a tiny question never used vafs before are there perks that control how slow time is in vafs? And how must each shot costs ap points


[8/30/2025 4:33 AM] gibonez
Kinda neat to replace vats although I do love vats just Bethesda never gave it enough complexity or attention


[8/30/2025 4:35 AM] ursorenda
we use YAE, within that system there are a few systems that interact with VAFs

Agility increases total AP
The type of gun you use affects AP cost per shot (handgun, shotgun, rifle, sniper)
The perks you have associated with those type of weapons may affect per shot AP cost in VAFs (anything that mentions VATs is the same as VAFs)


[8/30/2025 4:36 AM] ursorenda
I wouldn't rely on it as a mainstay. This isn't mad max. You won't be doing sick dive jumps in slowmo, it's more like "oh shit I didn't see that raider, lemme throw on VAFs so I can aim for his stupid forehead and not die"


[8/30/2025 7:31 AM] blursedbucket
Out of curiosity, what is it specifically in CK that makes save bloat happen


[8/30/2025 7:32 AM] blursedbucket
accumulation of data i assume right?


[8/30/2025 7:32 AM] blursedbucket
but like, how is there a limit


[8/30/2025 8:34 AM] tiburse
Think of the game engine as a balloon and the save as air. Once you put to much air into the balloon it goes POP. There you have the CTD.


[8/30/2025 8:34 AM] tiburse
I ran into it a few times while testing the settlement mods


[8/30/2025 8:34 AM] tiburse
Well, potential ones.


[8/30/2025 8:35 AM] tiburse

Hello, is there an easy way fo fix screen tearing? I play everything at 60fps and I tried playing around in both the nvidia panel as well as the ENB setting. Even with limiter or forced vsync, i still have the screen tearing.


[8/30/2025 10:03 AM] dragonpalm
what is save bloat?


[8/30/2025 10:23 AM] vextin
When a bunch of garbage data piles up in your save file


[8/30/2025 2:16 PM] dragonpalm
@The Sovereign can you delete my "Missing Files" support post, I'm gonna remake it so the message shows on the forum view

QQ: anyone noticed an issue where some chairs stop working for saving? I'm saved at a chair over an hour ago, now I stading at it again and I can't save, don't really want to lose the progress and I don't have the means to craft the quicksave thingy


[8/30/2025 2:49 PM] dragonpalm
did you download the cigarettes mod?


[8/30/2025 2:50 PM] dragonpalm
also I'm gonna hack carlbot and shut this bastard down if it gives me the prisoner role again


[8/30/2025 3:21 PM] lateralus9290
Don't even know what mod you are referring to. I just followed the instalation guide as a fresh install. But the odd thing is that saving did work at the start, ,it just randomly stopped


[8/30/2025 3:41 PM] dragonpalm
Yeah the chair thing is bugged, a mod that lets you save with cigarettes has been added to the beta but it's safe to manually add to this list. If you search cigarette in the server you'll see it, it's three mods altogether you'll need to add


[8/30/2025 4:11 PM] lateralus9290
I got the cigarette autosave mod as well as the dependency mod. Added them to the folder and enabled via MO2, but it's not doing anything. Is it a 'special' kind of cigarette that can be used for that? It's still considered as junk and therefore I cant 'use' it.


[8/30/2025 4:12 PM] dragonpalm
Did you download the cigarette file from the dependency as well?


[8/30/2025 4:12 PM] dragonpalm
It's three downloads total


[8/30/2025 4:13 PM] lateralus9290
I only saw Animated World as a dependency


[8/30/2025 6:31 PM] ursorenda
it needs to be updated, sadly the mod author hasn't responded.


[8/30/2025 7:22 PM] dragonpalm
If carlbot let me post links I'd post a guide with all the links and pictures lol


[8/30/2025 7:23 PM] dragonpalm
I'm almost tempted to wipe my install and do it again but with a video


[8/30/2025 7:24 PM] dragonpalm
or make it into a video rather

Which tool/config file do I need to use to specify graphics settings such as resolution, vsync or window/fullscreen? Bethini does not seem to register any config that I save. I've been trying to get a config with fullscreen 60fps with vsync enabled to avoid screen tearing.


[8/31/2025 10:15 AM] dragonpalm
🤔


[8/31/2025 10:16 AM] dragonpalm

[8/31/2025 11:52 AM] lateralus9290
ENB does have a vsync option and a fps limiter, both however cause severe screen tearing

[8/31/2025 9:51 PM] moondrift_66052
Eh, I'm okay with it. Temporarily being given the training is kinda cheesy. I think the idea that Preston and his guys all being dumb morons out of their depth who don't understand that power armor needs training fits right along with what we know about them.
And I managed to kill the Deathclaw anyway. The PA's use at the start isn't necessary, and I honestly wish it never existed from the start. Always stank of Todd trying to wow people to me.


[8/31/2025 9:52 PM] vextin
I agree completely


[8/31/2025 9:53 PM] vextin
I didn't even shoot the deathclaw, I ran to the balcony and it got distracted by some nasty creatures (a cerberus and some multi-torso zombie monster?) and those freaks did all the work for me

[8/31/2025 11:36 PM] nomad5157
Yes it all remains the same but is slowly being phased out as we get our launcher to be released which will help automate most of the install

[8/31/2025 11:48 PM] kingseabass9922
how do I update

do I just click on wabbajack and install again


[8/31/2025 11:48 PM] kingseabass9922
does it auto add the mod?


[8/31/2025 11:49 PM] ursorenda
yes. Grab your save folder from the installation directory (in the profiles folder) and put it on your desktop. Then delete you Install Directory. Make sure you don't delete the downloads folder, and tthen run wabbajack again


[8/31/2025 11:50 PM] kingseabass9922
does it install every mod over again or just add the ones added and removed

it doesn't need to *download* every mod again.

But it does need to install all of them again. Wabba has a bug when over writing that can cause issues.


[8/31/2025 11:51 PM] kingseabass9922
so itll take a while to update?


[8/31/2025 11:52 PM] ursorenda

Is there some type of tutorial or read-me that explains the radiation mechanics, particularly how to cure them? My dude is mad irradiated but not sure how to address it, I'm still in pre-Concord and totally irradiated with organ failure and Lithium Lung and a bunch of other stuff. Sudden death has got me twice already lol


[9/1/2025 2:37 PM] vextin
The big thing to understand is that Rads (RAD) and Iradiation (IRAD) are two different things which both accumulate. Rads come from the environment, Iradiation comes from ingestion. 

Rads also turn into Iradiation over time (as your body begins to "process" the Rads). High ***irradiation*** is what leads to radiation poisoning (lithium lung, cesium cold, uranium fever, etc).

So what you need to do is

1) get rid of your Rads with radaway or similar 

2) get rid of your irradiation with vodka or [the med that clears IRAD] 

3) get rid of your rad poisoning with the med that cures rad poisoning

Use the cheat terminal to teleport him to you


[9/1/2025 3:30 PM] ursorenda
You probably have high RADs. Look above your compass, how many green bars are there? If more than one: you have a lethal amount of RADs, has to be treated with Mutaway, or a doctor. 

Use the radboy in your inventory to check your IRAs. Eating and drinking will cause IRAs to rise, as can exposing yourself to radiation sources.


Both feed into each other. If you treat your rads a dose of cadtpa can treat rad poisoning


[9/1/2025 3:31 PM] ursorenda
That has been patched. They’re still not as durable as I’d like but no longer are they basically giant landmines

is tehr a way to disable the zombies without breaking the game

I LITERALLY get one shotby them and havent killed a single one.
Turn a corner in stealth, and op- zombie attacked me and i died immediately

I just died passing redrocket, dumping 20+ ammo into a zombie while running from it, only to dieafter one of the hoard got me and hit me


[9/1/2025 4:36 PM] ursorenda
the gameplay loop with zombies is "shoot them in the head if you have the ammo, run if you don't"

The short answer to your Q is no


[9/1/2025 5:06 PM] detectivelavender
has the difficulty been adjusted? bugs and mole rats taking several shots with the hunting rifle to kill. or did i mess up on the installation somewhere?

Are .50 rounds supposed to be cheap? I have 1 charisma and it cost only 12. I found a shoulder mounted M2 that has more damage than all my other weapons and explosives combined. I can now just shoot center mass on everything and it destroys things, especially with a sneak bonus.

By the time you have enough cores to even use it routinely, you'll be far enough to have the training. I don't really see the issue.

[9/1/2025 8:09 PM] punishedmobius
idk this obsession about removing player agency just fundamentally sits at odds.

IDK everyone here knows its controversial at best so let the people pick their side of the fence is all I want


[9/1/2025 8:10 PM] ursorenda
hitting up the Hot Rodders satisfies your condition of not wanting to touch the story. We can't really assist you past that. The choice was made to avoid making the early game feel like a joke (which PA will do, due to Bastion). You're welcome to provide constructive feedback in the appropriate channel if you think there's a better way to prevent explosive power scaling in the PC. If you want complete and total agency over things like access to broken, unearned advantages just because you want it, refer to my earlier comment about making your own modlist.


[9/1/2025 8:13 PM] detectivelavender
I don't think it really feels forced to touch the story per se. But if you want access to "miltarized" high end gear that you would have to at least interact with the faction that provides it.  Brotherhood has historically been the way to go for "early/easy" access to get gear of that quality in almost every fallout game. Otherwise it stands to reason that access to it would be pretty limited.


[9/1/2025 8:14 PM] ursorenda
The Vanilla game makes it significantly easier to get PA, so I at least understand where the "player agency" comment comes from. However, we didn't make this modpack with Vanilla in mind. We made it with design concepts taken from the STALKER series in mind. It's punishing for a reason, things aren't easy for a reason, you have to work for things.... *for a reason*


[9/1/2025 8:15 PM] nomad5157

[9/1/2025 8:19 PM] detectivelavender
Honestly i've enjoyed the experience of playing this without PA. I've put probably 50-60 hours in the modpack since i stumbled upon it. PA never really felt necessary or even desirable with the right builds.


[9/1/2025 8:20 PM] nomad5157
It's really one of the worst ideas bethesda has had to put power armor at the start of the game but I understand why they did it. In Fallout 3/ New Vegas it was several hours into your save that you get power armor.


[9/1/2025 8:20 PM] ursorenda
I agree whole heartedly. 

There've been a couple instances where I had to run around in PA for bug testing purposes and those moments felt like.... idk the Fallout Equivalent of watching those minecraft runner videos. zero challenge, barely took any damage, murdered whole areas and only once did I break any of the PA parts.


[9/1/2025 8:21 PM] detectivelavender
i was good with that though. Power armor was supposed to be *earned* not just sitting waiting on you to hop in with your first 30 mins of game time


[9/1/2025 8:21 PM] ursorenda
I agree with this as well. 

Though their reason was "we want fantastical reviews so lets make the 1-2 hours that'll be played by reviewers jam packed with *everything* the game has to offer"


[9/1/2025 8:21 PM] detectivelavender
FO4 cheapened PA so much


[9/1/2025 8:22 PM] detectivelavender
getting PA in newvegas, especially the enclave armor was such a satisfying moment and one i still remember well


[9/1/2025 8:24 PM] nomad5157
My reasoning for requiring training with the armor is that, while the Sole Survivor is canonically a soldier, being cryogenically frozen for over 200 years would have major effects on both memory and motor function. Long-term cryogenic suspension would disrupt neural pathways, especially those tied to procedural memory, muscle memory, and fine motor control.

From a scientific standpoint, freezing living tissue presents several problems:

* **Neural degradation:** When metabolic activity is stopped for centuries, synaptic connections weaken. This makes it harder to recall learned skills, which explains why the armor feels familiar but not intuitive.
* **Muscle atrophy and coordination loss:** Even if the body is preserved, two centuries without use would leave muscles weakened and coordination impaired, similar to how astronauts must rehabilitate after extended time in zero gravity.
* **Cognitive aftereffects:** The process could cause lingering fog, reduced reaction times, and fragmented recall, much like what happens after hypoxia or brain injury.

So, even though Nate recognizes the armor, his body and mind are essentially rebooting after centuries of inactivity. The line *“There’s just something about this I can’t put my finger on”* fits perfectly: he knows it should come naturally, but the details are locked behind degraded memory and dulled reflexes, making retraining necessary.

I also understand that some of you, in your headcanon, do not play as him. There will be changes in the future to accommodate all playstyles. Don't worry.


[9/1/2025 8:26 PM] nomad5157
Although it may seem like I just made this harder for the sake of it, there is real scientific thought behind it. That said, yes, I am a sadist regardless lol.


[9/1/2025 8:28 PM] nomad5157
Matter of fact in 0.6 there is a whole new lore behind losing memory functions when you first wake up etc.

A small mod to bring back power armor training. You will no longer be able to use Power Armor right out of the Vault and will need to find trainers in the world to teach you. Little mod big changes.

how do you save the game lol


[9/1/2025 9:21 PM] detectivelavender
you don't. ever.

[9/1/2025 9:21 PM] detectivelavender
cigarettes or a bed 😉


[9/1/2025 9:21 PM] nomad5157
Make sure you are on the newest build released a few hours ago


[9/1/2025 9:21 PM] d00dnice
i literally just installed lol


[9/1/2025 9:21 PM] d00dnice
like an hr ago


[9/1/2025 9:22 PM] nomad5157
Then like lavender said. Cigs or sleeping


[9/1/2025 9:23 PM] d00dnice
prolly should update starting loadouts then since install instructions call for creating a save and reloading it after applying MCM settings and if you choose a starting location not near a bed what are you supposed to do?


[9/1/2025 9:25 PM] nomad5157
That starting area is being remade right now so some changes are coming to it soon. The cigarettes should spawn pretty fairly. You can also craft survival packs at the chem bench that allow you to save also


[9/1/2025 9:33 PM] detectivelavender
somehow i've made it through sanctuary and concord without finding any lol

For gramphics/performance, just use Vramr.


[9/1/2025 10:59 PM] moondrift_66052
If you search for Vramr, Soggy Sandwich has a post detailing how to get the modlist to work on mid-range machines. It's the third from the top.


[9/1/2025 11:17 PM] sis783
Just downloaded and installed anomaly. Looks awesome but im having an issue. i read throug the readme and cant fix it with just that. The instructions are to go look at the chair to see if it says save. It does not. It then says if that happens to exit the game and reload. I did that but no matter how many times i do it never says save.


[9/1/2025 11:20 PM] vextin
Most recent version changes saving, now you need to smoke a cigarette or sleep


[9/1/2025 11:20 PM] vextin
Chair saves were bad or something


[9/1/2025 11:21 PM] sis783
Ok thanks.


[9/2/2025 1:01 AM] nomad5157
* **Removed** SKK Fast Start and SKK Location due to confusion in starting areas. Replaced SKK Fast Start with an alternative quick start mod.
* **Removed** the container outside the vault that contained overpowered armor.
* **Disabled** the AFT spouse message at game start.

New update coming out. This wil just affect new saves.


[9/2/2025 1:56 AM] detectivelavender
THERE WAS A CONTAINER OUTSIDE THE VAULT WITH ARMOR 😢

does a storywealth mod work well with anomaly


[9/2/2025 3:14 AM] catrotzuk
question, maybe I missed somthieng

IS vats just a non thing in this, cannot get vats to work, and a lot of the perks in the game deal with vats.

Did i miss someting with VATS?


[9/2/2025 3:40 AM] punishedmobius
They disabled Vats for VAFS slo mo

You can go into the VAFS mcm menu and turn it back on


[9/2/2025 3:40 AM] punishedmobius
which is my next suggestion


[9/2/2025 3:41 AM] punishedmobius
VATS and VAFS can live in harmony together


[9/2/2025 3:43 AM] punishedmobius
I enjoy VAFS but I also play Fallout specifically for VATS and yall are smoking OG brahmin Jet by defaulting to disable it

I do get the "anti spotter" angle to it but I think even a cost to activate Vats could be a tradeoff for that ability to spot things the player doesnt necessarily see


[9/2/2025 3:54 AM] ursorenda
I mean yes but no. 

we wont provide any support for anything involving VATs. We intend the modpack to use VAFs. If you'd like to use VATs that's your prerogative and we won't try to stop you. Please dont complain about how easy the game becomes with VATs


[9/2/2025 3:57 AM] punishedmobius
its a fair point that it makes initial ambushes EZ pz 

But I am still getting smoked if I try to use it in an active fight I stepped into.


[9/2/2025 3:58 AM] ursorenda
not really. It will conflict in many places that would require patching, and our focus is on stability which precludes SS2 (which will add a bunch of save bloat)


[9/2/2025 3:58 AM] ursorenda
VATs and VAFs use the same backend mechanism, anything that affects VATs also affects VAFs


[9/2/2025 3:59 AM] ursorenda
YMMV for accuracy, honestly I can't tell any difference with or without perks that influence VATs accuracy


[9/2/2025 3:59 AM] ursorenda
Cool.


[9/2/2025 4:00 AM] ursorenda
it's a pinned message


[9/2/2025 4:03 AM] ursorenda
there really aren't any every graphical mod we use we've also opted to include the 2k optionals. We've also created previs patches to increase performance. If you're having issues with graphics you want to look at disabling core isolation and making sure you followed *all* of the instructions in the install guide. If you didn't, you'll get poor performance (usually by the way of not setting exclusions in WD, not setting up pagefiles, and not installing the pre-requisite software)

Google Vramr if you're having issues, this modpack runs *perfectly* on systems running GTX 1070's.


[9/2/2025 4:31 AM] catrotzuk
OKay got it sorted, When playing you apply the profile for anomoly and it sayws " dont alter any thing below here"

So i was under impression the keybind for vats would trigger vats/vafs or whatever it was


But had to go to vafs and reassign keybind to something different from vats


[9/2/2025 4:31 AM] catrotzuk
thanks for the help and info guys

Loving anomaly! Any sources\ links to sources for in depth gameplay changes or tips? Theres so many mods i just dont know what exists that im not even taking advantage of. For all i know im missing out on key gameplay features.


[9/2/2025 12:04 PM] dailey116
Heyo, was just trying to download the modpack and encountered a problem. It keeps listing a few download errors, I attempt to rectify this by download the missing mods. I haven't been able to get any headway on the issue

@The Sovereign whats up with Gibletting enemies in this list?


[9/2/2025 2:22 PM] punishedmobius
I was trying WOD and I shot a corpse and its head popped like it should


[9/2/2025 2:25 PM] ursorenda
Not sure what you’re asking. 

Don’t tag me please.


[9/2/2025 2:25 PM] ursorenda
You can just ask your question


[9/2/2025 2:29 PM] punishedmobius
Butcher Pete stuff lol

like the bodies aren't dismember able?


[9/2/2025 2:29 PM] ursorenda
They are.


[9/2/2025 2:30 PM] punishedmobius
the heads arent popping when shot? as corpses? 

They do in WOD modlist and I am just trying to see why


[9/2/2025 2:31 PM] punishedmobius
while I am ob about it also Whats up with the one loading screen image?


[9/2/2025 2:31 PM] ursorenda
Just because they aren’t dismember-able via bullets doesn’t mean enemies don’t.

Go play that then, if it bothers you. We focus on realism, which we’ve stated multiple times. 

You’re welcome to your opinion on it either way.


[9/2/2025 2:33 PM] ursorenda
I’m gonna issue you a formal warning. There’s a place for player feedback, a quick comment here is fine but almost all of your comments here can (and should) be shared in the appropriate channel.


[9/2/2025 2:34 PM] ursorenda
If you have a question about a gameplay mechanic, feel free. If you have an opinion about a mechanic, aggregate them with a few others and use the player feedback channel.


[9/2/2025 2:37 PM] punishedmobius
the corpses are not dismembering

Live enemies will dismember as a kill shot 

The realism is my point lol. Trashcan carlas head should explode if I double tap her as a corpse


[9/2/2025 2:38 PM] punishedmobius
is it supposed to ggiblet?


[9/2/2025 2:41 PM] ursorenda
Bodies giblet with explosions. We dialed them back to avoid dismemberment when using bullets in regular combat. It’s a mechanical limitation due to the way dismemberment chance is mathematically calculated. 

If you absolutely need to see gore use explosive weapons.


[9/2/2025 2:42 PM] ursorenda
This is the kind of opinion I am communicating needs to be shared in the player feedback channel. You have far exceeded the acceptable amount of opinions on game mechanics in the general chat channel. Follow the rules and channel guides, please.

I think I screwed myself up. I selected hunter as the background and spawned with a remington 700 with a scope that has night vision. Just learned that you could swtich scopes yesterday. I found several other hunting rifles with some better parts so I took them off and placed on original gun, but now it's considered just a hunting rifle so I cant make use the special scopes other than zoom. Anyway to restore the gun to a remington?


[9/2/2025 5:04 PM] punishedmobius
Any reason there is just one single loading screen background?

Are there meant to be more and its not cycling?


[9/2/2025 5:06 PM] punishedmobius
its funny for a list that sends people to the loading screen so often via death there ought to be some variety lol


[9/2/2025 5:08 PM] ursorenda
I don’t believe so. Technically it should never have converted away from being a remmi


[9/2/2025 7:44 PM] catrotzuk
how to get Grease monkey perk to work?

Says you can use a wrench to get supplies from downed turrets, protectrons, etc

I built a wrench at the utility workbench, console command added various wrenches that are weapoins and had them equiped, 

Still nothing, and ZI dont know which mod it is that adds the ability to check


[9/2/2025 7:48 PM] vextin

hey anyone know why no weapons are spawning in the start vault? Cant progress because i cant kill any of the roaches and when i try to punch them i die because no stimpacks spawned aswell

Wait y'all played through the vault?


[9/3/2025 9:23 AM] dragonpalm
You're not supposed to start in the vault, but rather spawn at the top of the elevator. Nothing stopping you from turning around and heading back in though.

So I reached the Power Armor on the rooftop for the When Freedom Calls quest. I also grabbed the holotape in the vertibird however I still cannot wear the PA. Is this intentional? The holotape said I can wear PA up to 350 DR right?


[9/3/2025 12:12 PM] quizzy317
I also see the Power Armor training perk in my perk list.


[9/3/2025 12:18 PM] quizzy317
I read through previous messages and saw the holotape is extra training and that you still need to find someone to actually train you on PA.

[9/3/2025 3:05 PM] nomad5157
What antivirus


[9/3/2025 3:07 PM] lateralus9290
bitdefender


[9/3/2025 3:12 PM] nomad5157
Don't use third-party antivirus, they are worthless. The antivirus built into Windows is all you need. It updates almost daily and third-party ones just slow things down or cause problems. If you must use a 3rd party I suggest malwarebytes


[9/3/2025 3:22 PM] tiburse
This, as someone who has been working with infosec for 10 years. As long as you dont download sketchy shit, click adds on religious websites(study's have been conducted to show that they are far more likely to contain malware) , or click adds on porn sites you will be fine with windows av.


[9/3/2025 4:40 PM] quizzy317
Dude so I was up on that roof sniping with a carbine. I forgot I was sick with the weak muscles thing or whatever it is that causes your character to ragdoll. My girl ragdolled off the building onto the street, breaking both legs only to have the deathclaw come over and beat her to death, it was amazing.

[9/3/2025 10:01 PM] coolkid414121
this happen yesterday too

@The Sovereign hi sorry for ping, several people have had this issue today, are devs aware


[9/3/2025 10:15 PM] .skeetin
Probably a dumb question - in Concord when you find suit of power armor: there is a holotape called "power armor training" that says I have some sort of basic understanding of power armor usage, however when I try to enter the suit, it says I can't use it, i.e "someone might know how to teach me".

Probably something I will get later, but thought i'd ask in case - amazing  modpack, best i've ever played for F04 so far!


[9/3/2025 10:21 PM] nomad5157
New compile has been pushed close wabbajack wait 5 minutes and try again


[9/3/2025 10:21 PM] nomad5157
Thank you for the kind words yes it's part of the training


[9/3/2025 10:22 PM] .skeetin
Got it, figured, makes sense anyways as its not too balanced to get it at the beginning of the game.

Seriously though this modpack is amazing so far, loved every aspect of it

[9/4/2025 6:09 AM] lateralus9290
Had the same issue, but it's just well hidden. There are basically two sections, one accessed directly through a manhole, the other through the civic access. The ID card is right under/next to a skeleton in a rubble, very hard to spot unless you know where to look. The skeleton is from of the locked door (for an ID card) and it's in the section that you access via the manhole directly.


[9/4/2025 8:10 AM] thewhiteladylovesyoumore
unsure if the post i made in support forums fits that, but the starting pistol in vault 111 seems to be just missing for me? im unsure if this was removed or something, but just starting my first playthrough and im kinda worried that ill just lose all my progress if i cant make it to a bed with the damn thing


[9/4/2025 8:20 AM] martyr.kix
I'm going back to concord for another purpose so I'll be sure to check it out. Thank you.


[9/4/2025 8:23 AM] martyr.kix
If you look around the vault you should be able to find some cigarettes. They will act as a save mechanic and there is a pistol near sanctuary that is in 10mm so all the ammo you collect is usable.


[9/4/2025 8:33 AM] thewhiteladylovesyoumore
so the one thats on the overseer desk has infact been removed?

ill make sure to look through all of the houses in sanctuary again

also, the BoS armor right out of the vault in the wooden boxes, is that intended? I feel like its kinda OP, but knowing this mod im unsure if it really is, Just unsure if this is a mod putting it there as a "test" suit of armor, rather than legitimate loot


[9/4/2025 9:11 AM] nomad5157
it should be near the button to open the vault hatch


[9/4/2025 9:12 AM] nomad5157
That should be removed you're possibly not on the most updated version


[9/4/2025 9:15 AM] martyr.kix
It was still there for me and I had to go through Vault 111 and not through SKS alt start.


[9/4/2025 9:37 AM] thewhiteladylovesyoumore
Got it through wabbajack 🤔


[9/4/2025 9:39 AM] nomad5157
check again on there. I pushed an update early this morning


[9/4/2025 10:03 AM] quizzy317
How do I make the little white and orange man icon bigger? I've looked in FallUI and am able to make other elements bigger but can't find anything for the armor(?) hud.


[9/4/2025 10:33 AM] quizzy317
Found it, it's the Condition Boy mod.


[9/4/2025 11:30 AM] lateralus9290
Which mod is responsible for the white underwear? I'd like to change it if possible, it's too 'clean'. Not really looking into a nude version.


[9/4/2025 11:54 AM] nomad5157
You can just install an underwear mod


[9/4/2025 12:11 PM] joekrogan
BethINI is not saving any of my changes upon a fresh install of Anomaly. I have MO2 closed, and am launching from the tools folder BethINI exe as admin. I have started the modlist once through MO2, checked read-only status, etc. nothing seems to work or be the cause. Anyone else have any thoughts?


[9/4/2025 12:16 PM] joekrogan
Strange, it seems the fallout exe in the stock folder was not being routed to bethini correctly. I changed it to the exe manually and now it saved and the resolution changes I needed are reflected in game. I would not take this as an example to follow, the guide says not to change the ini paths, so if I bricked my list, its on me lol


[9/4/2025 12:30 PM] trishten1985
Ok dumb question I manually downloaded the hud and placed it into download but I’m still getting a error and the only things it shows missing is hud and the ENB

Thank you!


[9/4/2025 1:45 PM] lateralus9290
Won't that conflict with whatever mod is adding the current underwear? That is why I was trying to figure out which one from the list is responsible. Usually when it comes to bodies, you just get 1 or 2 mods and that's it. or at least that is how I used to do it. But there are quite a few mods that modify both the mesh and textures of bodies.


[9/4/2025 1:46 PM] nomad5157
It’s CBBE which can not be removed. You can install an underwear mod if it bothers you that much. It’s just a texture overwrite


[9/4/2025 1:49 PM] lateralus9290

i have a 3070 but it can drop from 120 to 40 and im wondering if thats normal


[9/4/2025 4:26 PM] nomad5157
Fallout 4 is not an optimized game at all. We have done everything to help with performance.  Do not expect to hold 120 at all times.


[9/4/2025 4:41 PM] ursorenda
did you set the paths inside bethini?


[9/4/2025 5:06 PM] joekrogan
I did not set them until I had my issue. I followed the guide and made sure to close MO2, not touch the inis, only change res, etc.

It was when I was trouble shooting and actually looking at the ini path that I discovered that my path was not working correctly


[9/4/2025 5:06 PM] joekrogan
I will say I have downloaded this list numerous times with no hitch, this was never a problem

[9/4/2025 8:49 PM] nomad5157

bed save works well, chairs save are dissable

Some will not all act as a saving item it needs to be balanced a bit more


[9/4/2025 9:09 PM] kunkyxx
they are label differently or all it's just packs of cigs

Hello again. I’m about to start installing Anomaly. Just wondering if there’s any collectible mods like Ketaros Treasures or something alike? And if not would there be any issues if I installed it myself?


[9/5/2025 1:05 AM] nomad5157
Ketaros will be in 0.6 the full package


[9/5/2025 1:06 AM] nomad5157
You will need to check in xedit for conflicts

having fun with the mod so far, but unfortunately the effects im getting are just insane, moving at overencumbered speed 24/7 while stumbling nonstop and constantly taking damage from my effects

wondering if this is the average playthrough, but i guess learning how to mitigate these is all part of it

Hey guys, just came across Anomaly and it looks really impressive!


[9/5/2025 10:57 AM] tomanyone
Does it include the Silent Protagonist mod, and any Alternate Start mods?


[9/5/2025 11:17 AM] quizzy317
What's meant to be the order of operation for healing crippled limbs in the field? Specifically legs. Both my legs are busted. I use a splint to get them to 1 HP then what? I tried using a stimpak to heal them but they stayed at 1 and just broke again after a few seconds. I was not in combat.


[9/5/2025 11:21 AM] nomad5157
Silent is not included. It conflicts with mods we use. We no longer have alt start mods. We have our own personal setup when coming out of the vault.

you might have run across the carry weight bug. You're supposed to have around 100 units of carry weight in the beginning with zero points in strength. if you have less open the survival settings menu in the MCM and disable weight reduction.

Oh yeah maybe LOL, I just ended up starting a new save anyways, figured my management with rads and food/water could’ve been better


[9/5/2025 4:01 PM] ursorenda
Avoid doing that in the future. We will get to you when we can, remember that the support staff and devs all also have personal lives, and it’s a work day.

Yeah I think it wasn’t just that, I had like 3 reoccurring illnesses just from radiation, and no way to get more anti rads etc, would be fine to learn from the mistakes and retrace my steps in half the time


[9/5/2025 4:06 PM] martyr.kix
Just a little fun bug happened. I reloaded a save and I got every crafting bench I needed spawn into the access tunnels (underground railroad fast travel mod). Any normal F4 playthrough I'd cheese this, but I'm going to reload the same save and see if it reverts.


[9/5/2025 4:21 PM] safetysocks

[9/5/2025 5:22 PM] nomad5157
We do have a guide. It's actually several pages long. (People never read it anyway) we are updating it as it's outdated with some of the recent changes we've made.


[9/5/2025 5:23 PM] blurryfaceandrew
what !?  i  didnt see it in the readme


[9/5/2025 5:23 PM] nomad5157

Is there a possibility to allocate a background after finishing the vault and sleeping at a bed inm Sanctuary?
I had 0 points in background inside vault :/


[9/5/2025 5:48 PM] nomad5157
Will get it resolved. Should start off with 2


[9/5/2025 5:49 PM] devianttechnq
I had 2 traits applied just fine, but not the background. This has happened across a couple other modlists I installed recently.


[9/5/2025 5:55 PM] martyr.kix
I had this happen to me but I just played on with it. You gain a passive perk and some additional points. It didn't have impact on me


[9/5/2025 5:57 PM] devianttechnq
I went into the YAE MCM, incremented background value slider from 1 to 2, closed MCM, re-entered, go to bonus commands, enter background menu, selected a background and package.
Working now, for some reason it's just not setting the value initially.


[9/5/2025 6:36 PM] ursorenda

Hi again lol. Hopefully last time I have to ask anything. Is this proper place to put the Fallout Anomaly HUDS.zip and enbseries_fallout4_v0501.zip? 

I’ve tried putting them in the download folder, extracting them and then putting them in the download folder, but nothing works. I’m still kinda new to PC modding and PCs in general so still trying to get my ducks in a row. 

Sorry if this seems like a really stupid question. I’ve read the Google Drive Install Guide and don’t understand the Download Directory portion.

For me it's quite fair and balanced. It is hard and it will punish you both long term and short term depending on the situation. However its addictive, very addictive

[9/6/2025 12:08 AM] nomad5157
You can see the difference there


[9/6/2025 12:09 AM] martyr.kix
Mines very stable. However it depends on both your build or when bethesda wants to shit the bed


[9/6/2025 12:09 AM] omgwronghole.
My PC build you mean?


[9/6/2025 12:09 AM] martyr.kix
Yeah. It recommend 32gbs of ram but the min is 16 if I'm correct


[9/6/2025 12:10 AM] omgwronghole.
I should be good


[9/6/2025 12:11 AM] martyr.kix
Everything is in #📖install-guide in regards of build and specs


[9/6/2025 12:12 AM] martyr.kix
But mod stability I've had 1 crash in 13 hours playtime


[9/6/2025 12:13 AM] martyr.kix
Oh yeahh those tweaks are really nice. Colours pop for sure


[9/6/2025 12:13 AM] omgwronghole.
Im a little anxious bc i put like 80 hours into a modded BG3 playthrough and it just started to fall apart. Eventually wouldnt load my saves anymore 🙁


[9/6/2025 12:13 AM] omgwronghole.
What enb is that


[9/6/2025 12:14 AM] martyr.kix
The main wabba version is the most stable version of anomaly you'll get.

There is a lot in store for 0.6


[9/6/2025 12:18 AM] martyr.kix
That's one thing I've already mentioned in my feedback. This modpack really gives atmosphere,  the feeling I got playing fallout 3 for the first time many years ago on the ps3.

How far away are we from 0.6 being the main version. Vaguely as I know there's tons of resources being put into this

[9/6/2025 12:21 AM] nomad5157
Coming along well but It will be several months off. I'm giving testers the time they need to fully play through


[9/6/2025 12:22 AM] nomad5157
Also making new areas for anomaly in creation kit takes time etc


[9/6/2025 12:22 AM] martyr.kix
That is very fair. I had strong feeling it wasn't going to be soon


[9/6/2025 12:23 AM] nomad5157
Our new frameworks require everything to be rebuilt but there is a huge load of new content coming


[9/6/2025 12:23 AM] nomad5157
It will also be the most stable version of anomaly


[9/6/2025 12:24 AM] nomad5157

[9/6/2025 12:26 AM] martyr.kix
Topping this version on stability that's a big task in its own right. Granted my build is top of range. I've only had 1 crash which is already been reported several times.

Hm, updated the mod list via wabbajack, and now I cant save with chair again. To make it worse, the cigarettes are not working either. Do you now need to pick a 'new' cigarette since all the ones I had in inventory became scrap.


[9/6/2025 4:14 PM] malfas.infandum
Helloooo, I downlaoded the modlist, getting stuck on the ENB. I cannot find any direct instructions on what to download from the webpage the http download link pops up.

Chair saves are no longer used. ~~Yes, it’s a different kind of cigarette “pack of cigarettes”~~ All cigarettes work.

I am sorry, but I see nothing pertaining to missing files.

[9/6/2025 4:51 PM] lateralus9290
I noticed that one of the dependend mod was missing from MO for the cigarettes, after I installed it again, I could use cigarettes again.


[9/6/2025 5:09 PM] nomad5157
That's strange I'll take a look at the compile

It's not something you can craft yet. You can go to the doctor and buy them

Quick question and not sure what I’m missing and thanks for all the help in the past. But I’ve enabled the optional controller option and it’s not showing up as active. The controller some what works but will not open the pip boy. What am I doing wrong?


[9/6/2025 10:50 PM] ursorenda
our mod pack isn't exactly controller friendly


[9/6/2025 10:51 PM] ursorenda
if you navigate to the optional in MO2 and right click, then select "visit on nexus" there are instructions you should follow'


[9/6/2025 10:52 PM] ursorenda
but YMMV, not all users are able to get it to apply and even if it does sometimes it just stops working randomly. 

A quick fix that has worked for some users is to go into keybinds in the pause menu and reset to default.


[9/6/2025 10:58 PM] trishten1985
Your the best! Thank you I’ll give this a try!

[9/6/2025 11:02 PM] ursorenda
possibly, but you'll have to figure out for yourself how to re-enable CC content in game. There are .ini settings that need to be changed, you'll have to google for em


[9/6/2025 11:03 PM] ursorenda
Generally speaking it doesn't break *too* much, one of our beta testers is big on settlement stuff and hasn't reported too many issues in that regard

[9/7/2025 5:02 AM] trout_hunter
Looks like some similar bugs to this happen, anyone know how to fix "Data_Scripts_Source_DLC01_DLC01.zip This is a game file that could not be found. Validate the game is installed properly in the same language as that of the modlist author." ?


[9/7/2025 5:47 AM] just_baron
Hello, folks. Haven't tried Anomaly for a one and a half years, looks cool now.

A few questions, however. 
1) How to save or to turn saves back on?
2) Why enemies (mutants) are bullet sponges? Just reached Red Rocket, bloatflies and molerats are impossible to kill with "kimber" (? or whatever the name of that 1911) 10 mm, regular molerat took 2 with half mags to dump in the body/head.
3) Shift+Enter doesn't open ENB.
4) How to collect meat from molerats?


[9/7/2025 6:00 AM] yami_ger
1. Either sleep or cigs or survival packs
2. Caliber is keypoint for some enemies so no more killing behemoths wizh .38
3. Iirc its end key for enbs might be wrong
4. Have a knife or sharp weapon in inv to harvest meat pf em


[9/7/2025 6:04 AM] just_baron
But damn, shouldn't 10mm kill insects and molerats fast? Wasting 3 mags on a critter is bs.


[9/7/2025 6:08 AM] yami_ger
Oh yeah if ya dont hit the head pf a critter it can tale a few rounds


[9/7/2025 6:09 AM] yami_ger
I can say use a melee weapon early for critters or ordnance if ya can get em to pile up even a car can do the job


[9/7/2025 6:11 AM] yami_ger
Also need to fogure put myself why i have no jump button


[9/7/2025 6:18 AM] just_baron
Nah, that's the deal, molerat was stunned and I am sure that I've dumped an entire mag in its head.

So, why 10mm bullets deal less damage than  melee?


[9/7/2025 6:21 AM] yami_ger
you applied the mcm preset correct could have been an bug maybe then if applied


[9/7/2025 6:27 AM] nomad5157

Hey, i joined the discord because i had the same issue. i just tried again and it works now. i tried everything in the install guide to no avail and i also installed and ran the fallout creation kit from steam and after that it worked. idk if that was a server issue that resolved itself now or if that was a solution but you could try that.


[9/7/2025 8:24 AM] blurryfaceandrew
literally just had same issue lol, download the creation kit


[9/7/2025 8:25 AM] lateralus9290
I swear there is a loot goblin in the abandonned tunnels. I keep delivering materials and yet, each time I seem to be missing most of the components


[9/7/2025 10:01 AM] ursorenda
Sounds like you didn’t read the install guide 🙃


[9/7/2025 10:01 AM] ursorenda
Always delete your installation directory before updating


[9/7/2025 10:04 AM] ursorenda
That’s outdated. They’re supported


[9/7/2025 10:06 AM] ursorenda
No clue about life in the ruins tbh, but this will likely be the most hardcore experience you’ll find in the modlist community.


[9/7/2025 10:07 AM] skrizpy
is it a common problem with failing to install enbseries? and also Data_Scripts_source_DLC01


[9/7/2025 10:07 AM] skrizpy

[9/7/2025 10:08 AM] skrizpy
did not have this issue some months ago when i installed the pack


[9/7/2025 11:02 AM] ursorenda
you would have had to manually download and install enb whether you played a week ago or a year ago.

scrolling through and saw that someone was talking about spongey enemies, there is an MCM preset that is supposed to be set to make them less spongey?


[9/7/2025 12:26 PM] ursorenda
they're referring to a need to better balance the changes made by true damage. The MCM preset included *does* need to be applied but that won't stop super mutants from eating entire clips of 10mm to the face. 

It's an intended feature, but needs fine tuning to avoid "vanilla-like" scenarios.


[9/7/2025 12:27 PM] ursorenda
in the mean time, use anything with 5.56 or higher. 

.357 magnum will also work nicely, as long as you aim for the head


[9/7/2025 12:28 PM] han8671
I tried a bit the modlist before and I just wondered, how am I supposed to start? I get killed very quick but ennemies won't die and I don't have ammo.


[9/7/2025 12:28 PM] han8671
where should I start to get stronger?


[9/7/2025 12:28 PM] ursorenda
look to the satelite station north east of sanctuary


[9/7/2025 12:28 PM] ursorenda
they will still kill you dead if you aren't smart about your approach and good with your aim, but it'll be easier than concord


[9/7/2025 12:29 PM] han8671
thank you, concord was way too rough lol


[9/7/2025 12:29 PM] ursorenda
it's supposed to be my friend, you need decent gear to get through most of the mid and late game


[9/7/2025 12:30 PM] han8671
I did expect concord to be harder (like how skyrim modlist makes bleak falls barrow harder) but I didn't know where to go to get geared up

[9/7/2025 1:06 PM] tiburse
That was removed in the latest version and changed to the cig to save mod.


[9/7/2025 1:07 PM] han8671
what is cig to save?


[9/7/2025 1:07 PM] ursorenda
exactly what it says on the tin. You use cigarettes as a consumable in order to save

[9/7/2025 1:10 PM] therhythmz
After a lot of testing, and i mean A LOT of testing, i have concluded that NAC X provides way better performance even when compared to vanilla lighting. My guess is that it processes lighting in a different way that does not require taking Occlusion into account. It also doesn't edit cells in any way so it should be perfectly okay to slap it on top of the lighting cell edits present on the modpack, or at least it hasn't given me any issue at all. I completely uprooted and disabled the ENB part of the modpack from the root folder and other locations. Its running completely vanilla in terms of DLL. Might need to fiddle a bit on FO4Edit so it leaves ELFX alone and functions independently.


[9/7/2025 1:12 PM] ursorenda
I wouldn't spend too much time on that, we're migrating over to NAC X on the next release (as of now, anyway. may change but I doubt it)

[9/7/2025 1:13 PM] ursorenda
since that's a feature baked into vanilla, you could but it would take some doing and we don't support, so any issues you have regarding saves... we would direct you to reinstall the entire modpack first


[9/7/2025 1:14 PM] ursorenda
test this out see if it solves your issue

[9/7/2025 1:14 PM] therhythmz
Autosaves and quicksaves break mods sometimes. Only specific kinds of autosaves and manual saves dont mess things up. I'd suggest sticking to chairs and beds.


[9/7/2025 1:14 PM] ursorenda
we moved to cig to save, beds still work though

[9/7/2025 1:16 PM] tiburse
Only thing I dislike about NAC X is the "darken on entering building" thing it has going


[9/7/2025 1:17 PM] ursorenda
read below the linked comment.


[9/7/2025 1:17 PM] ursorenda
leave your downloads folder in tact, find and use the existing one since it'll already have downloaded all the necessary mods


[9/7/2025 1:19 PM] therhythmz
You can fiddle with it so it doesn't do that. You can edit lighting values for interiors and exteriors independently. It simply uses HDR to do it. I suggest using "resident evil II" preset along with the last one, i think it was called "vivid". All other settings should recieve absolutely minimal adjustment. -1 or +1 at the most. I'll tell you in a bit. I spent a looong time tweaking it.


[9/7/2025 1:20 PM] martyr.kix
I'm sure you can tweak the settings to remove that. Can't fully remember it's been awhile since I've used NAC X


[9/7/2025 1:21 PM] han8671
I have a pistol that uses 9mm but it can use 9x19mm parabellum, is it normal?


[9/7/2025 1:21 PM] tiburse
Depends on the gun, as we have both the US and Russian versions.


[9/7/2025 1:22 PM] tiburse
Russia being a little odd in their ammo types xD


[9/7/2025 1:23 PM] ursorenda
we're working on pruning the ammo system in general, there's far too many ammo type variations


[9/7/2025 1:23 PM] therhythmz
Disabling lighting adjustment leads to really annoying bugs like everything looking extremely white permanently whenever you look at a really bright spot. Certain presets dont have this problem. The "Dark Shadows" preset is very annoying and it produces a lot of artifacting in dark areas, and it makes the noise dithering extremely noticeable. As i said, Resident Evil II preset along with the last one (Vivid or Vibrant, i dont recall what its name is).


[9/7/2025 1:24 PM] jonathanlazos
mod was removed


[9/7/2025 1:24 PM] therhythmz
I think i also adjusted static contrast to +1. Im hopping on the game in like 5 minutes so i can confirm.


[9/7/2025 1:25 PM] tiburse
Ill have to play with it and find out


[9/7/2025 1:29 PM] han8671
can we disable the Depth of field effect?

👍

[9/7/2025 1:31 PM] han8671
jsut a suggestion, could we get daddysaves like in gamma?


[9/7/2025 1:34 PM] therhythmz
Just checked. Settings are presets Resident Evil 1 and Vivid, and i adjusted contrast +1. Dont touch anything else. Adjusting Gamma makes things sitting in dark spot disappera completely because it is EXTREMELY dark even in the daytime. And HDR contrast makes that lighting issue that adjust in dark places a LOT worse. My recommendation is sticking to presets, static contrast and the Sunlight and Skylight sliders EXCLUSIVELY. Beyond that, the interiors and nights darkening presets id say is up to your taste. I personally use the regular darker nights and darker interiors settings. Beyond that its EXTREMELY dark, but they're usable, depending on how deep you wanna go in the "survival horror" direction.


[9/7/2025 1:35 PM] ursorenda
unlikely that we will officially add any further save options. We use cigs to save for a reason (mainly because it has the least contribution to save bloat)


[9/7/2025 1:36 PM] therhythmz
Quicksaves break mods. If they can code it to work with regular saves it might be a good idea. But quicksaves on mod-intensive lists are a no-no.

if you come across any cigs (packs or cartons) that don't seem to work just drop em from inventory and then pick up back up. for whatever reason that fixes the save tag

you would use them in the console like normal?


[9/7/2025 1:49 PM] malfas.infandum
yes, it just says that the batch file could not found or open. I have never used them in a modlist before, so I did not know if there is an extra step im missing


[9/7/2025 1:49 PM] ursorenda
are you placing them in the stock folder?


[9/7/2025 1:50 PM] ursorenda
not the steam folder, the folder literally named "stock folder" in the install directory

[9/7/2025 2:05 PM] tiburse
after its in the stock folder you have to close the game and MO2 then relaunch


[9/7/2025 2:05 PM] tiburse
then in console in game its "bat name"

Damn it, I just realized why I kept missing ccomponents all the time. I have a habit of scrapping junk into components, and apparently without the right perk, I only get the basic stuff from it. What a wase 🙁

You should be able to craft some of the junk items you need for other crafts in the utility workbench


[9/7/2025 2:28 PM] lateralus9290
That wasn't the problem. I kept scrapping every junk thinking I get the full component from them, that is why I always got confused when I tried to modify a gun and never had enough components for upgrades.

is it included in anonmaly?


[9/7/2025 3:03 PM] ursorenda
manually add it via MO2


[9/7/2025 3:06 PM] martyr.kix
All mine look like stuff you'd find in Wolfenstein. Concrete, concrete and you guessed it. Concrete 😂

[9/7/2025 3:07 PM] martyr.kix
that is very fair. I just like big block with everything in


[9/7/2025 3:08 PM] tiburse
That is also fair


[9/7/2025 3:08 PM] tiburse
less time building more time playing lol


[9/7/2025 3:09 PM] han8671
I love building


[9/7/2025 3:09 PM] han8671
especially doing power armor workshops


[9/7/2025 3:09 PM] martyr.kix
and less time trying to figure out what piece has canned the whole build


[9/7/2025 3:09 PM] ursorenda
that's called "brutalist architecture" :p


[9/7/2025 3:10 PM] martyr.kix

[9/7/2025 3:16 PM] tiburse
Sounds like a need for this


[9/7/2025 3:22 PM] han8671
when you use it, does it stay at 99% for a long time?


[9/7/2025 3:23 PM] han8671
can't use it, once all is placed I have 30 fps lol


[9/7/2025 3:23 PM] han8671
I'll use vramr and look again after


[9/7/2025 3:24 PM] ursorenda
if you mean while it's building, I get that as well. Once built I have zero issues.


[9/7/2025 3:24 PM] han8671
nah it finished building and I still have 30-40 fps


[9/7/2025 3:24 PM] ursorenda
while you're at it, I would recommend turning off core isolation if you have an AMD cpu. give it a google


[9/7/2025 3:24 PM] han8671
ususally I had 55-70 fps


[9/7/2025 3:24 PM] han8671
I have intel cpu, but amd gpu


[9/7/2025 3:32 PM] ursorenda
should be fine then. The frame rate issue is nebulous and varies from user to user, we haven't quite pinned down why it happens to people


[9/7/2025 3:39 PM] mu6dv6ay6ne
I just got to Preston myself. Had to take a break before I endure any more lol.

[9/7/2025 3:41 PM] han8671
I used the quality preset in vramr, it make a tiny files and the process only took 2 min


[9/7/2025 3:41 PM] han8671
something's wrong


[9/7/2025 3:50 PM] han8671
I must be incompetent and doing something wrong, even with optimised preset I get a 45mb files

[9/7/2025 4:15 PM] han8671
is there a way to enable the crosshair, especially for 3rd person


[9/7/2025 4:16 PM] nomad5157
Doing good sir


[9/7/2025 4:31 PM] han8671
do skills like longarms and handgun matter? is it only hipfire?


[9/7/2025 4:40 PM] han8671
man I feel like weapons don't do damage sometimes


[9/7/2025 4:50 PM] tiburse
Caliber is important.


[9/7/2025 4:51 PM] tiburse
As enemies can use armor plates as well.


[9/7/2025 4:51 PM] tiburse
They do


[9/7/2025 4:51 PM] tiburse
At a point you will need them ranked up not only for the YAE passives (you can check at what lvl you get what in the mod manager) and the bonus damage.


[9/7/2025 4:52 PM] tiburse
For damage though if you look on the left of the perk screen dont forget to gram the associated perks for the damage along with leveling the skill. I learned this the hard way my first time through as this modpack was my first ever playthrough of any modded fallout.


[9/7/2025 5:05 PM] han8671
I used 5.56 on a bandit in concord and it took like 6-7 shots


[9/7/2025 5:06 PM] tiburse
Were you hitting the same part? Aiming center or mass or all head?


[9/7/2025 5:06 PM] han8671
center


[9/7/2025 5:09 PM] tiburse
Thats why, they have armor plate access just like we do ;p


[9/7/2025 5:10 PM] tiburse
any plate L3 or higher can stop 5.56


[9/7/2025 5:16 PM] han8671
kinda hard to get headshots with how many of them there are


[9/7/2025 5:16 PM] han8671
I leave cover and 10 guys hoot at me, if not more


[9/7/2025 5:18 PM] blurryfaceandrew
so before enabling  the optional controler mod, i need to have aleast onesave file? the instructions for the mod says it wont work on a new game.


[9/7/2025 5:21 PM] vextin
1) use VAFS
2) use Uneducated Shooter Q/E leaning (must be enabled in MO2 after you start a newgame)
3) don't engage fights you can't win


[9/7/2025 5:21 PM] vextin
VAFS is bound to G, using a critical is Z


[9/7/2025 5:25 PM] jonathanlazos
game runs but as soon as i hit new game it gets stuck on loading screen


[9/7/2025 5:38 PM] yami_ger
Thats great to hear


[9/7/2025 5:50 PM] vextin
With the amount of progress Nomad's making on 0.6 I might just skip the DLCs and finish up faction/MSQ,,,


[9/7/2025 5:55 PM] nomad5157
DLCs will be getting love in 0.6


[9/7/2025 5:55 PM] nomad5157
Please look at our help page at top of discord.


[9/7/2025 5:56 PM] nomad5157
Suggest not going to concord at start of game unless you're a good shot


[9/7/2025 5:56 PM] han8671
okay, I'll explore more


[9/7/2025 6:01 PM] bezurkrage
is vats disabled?


[9/7/2025 6:02 PM] ursorenda

...76?


[9/7/2025 6:02 PM] bezurkrage
MCM*


[9/7/2025 6:02 PM] ursorenda
under gameplay


[9/7/2025 6:02 PM] kiiillers
yes


[9/7/2025 6:02 PM] nomad5157
That can be ignored


[9/7/2025 6:03 PM] kiiillers
the installation would fail


[9/7/2025 6:03 PM] bezurkrage
is it labled as VAFS or under a dif bias?


[9/7/2025 6:03 PM] ursorenda
It is labeled VAFs


[9/7/2025 6:04 PM] nomad5157
It should not block your install that is a typical error in wabbajack log. Obviously if you're installing for fallout 4 then it will not stop you from installing


[9/7/2025 6:05 PM] kiiillers
okay thank you i'll investigate


[9/7/2025 6:05 PM] bezurkrage
must not installed it then because i dont see a VAFS in gameplay


[9/7/2025 6:06 PM] vextin
its in User Interface

hey guys, how do you update the game? using only wabbajack? I just downloaded the game, but I wish to play the last version of the game, I dont know if it this one


[9/7/2025 6:32 PM] martyr.kix
Hello there


[9/7/2025 6:33 PM] vextin
version of what "game"? Fallout 4, or the Anomaly modpack?


[9/7/2025 6:33 PM] tiburse
Was it the one by carhenge?


[9/7/2025 6:33 PM] tiburse
Cause I hid in the gift shop and took pot shots at him when I could manage right after a rock would land


[9/7/2025 6:33 PM] martyr.kix
One by the glowing sea. Just outside one of AR2 quest locations


[9/7/2025 6:33 PM] malfas.infandum
how do I learn how to use power armour lol

@Vex the anomaly modpack


[9/7/2025 6:34 PM] tiburse
One of the factions that use power armor will teach you how. Once you get far enough in the quests with them


[9/7/2025 6:34 PM] kikooo1611

grab your saves out of install directory (where you installed FOA) > Profiles > Fallout Anomaly Beta > Saves and put em on your desktop

**delete your install directory**

**DO NOT DELETE YOUR DOWNLOADS DIRECTORY**

Meaning if your downloads folder is inside your install directory, **take it out and put it somewhere else first**

Run wabbajack like normal to install the modpack, it will install the most recent version.


[9/7/2025 6:54 PM] ursorenda
Pinned a message.


[9/7/2025 7:05 PM] smallbomb78v
how do I get support?


[9/7/2025 7:06 PM] ursorenda
check pinned comment in that channel


[9/7/2025 7:06 PM] ursorenda
does it involve the fallout 76 error


[9/7/2025 7:09 PM] smallbomb78v
I went to the fillout but it doesn't take me anywhere, and no FO76 error, just the install needs one game file (meshes.ba2) and everything else is fine so far


[9/7/2025 7:09 PM] smallbomb78v
its the last thing to install


[9/7/2025 7:09 PM] ursorenda
that's just a wabba false positive error. if you read the install guide it outlines that this may happen from time to time and there's literally nothing we can do about it.


[9/7/2025 7:10 PM] smallbomb78v
what does that mean for me?


[9/7/2025 7:10 PM] ursorenda
retry later and hope wabbajack downloads the meta file correctly


[9/7/2025 7:11 PM] ursorenda
some users only have to wait a few minutes, other users have had to wait a few days. We have no clue why it does that, only that it does


[9/7/2025 7:11 PM] smallbomb78v
hmmm, welp


[9/7/2025 7:11 PM] smallbomb78v
would a wabba log help?


[9/7/2025 7:12 PM] smallbomb78v
maybe it did it and just idk


[9/7/2025 7:12 PM] ursorenda
no, it's a known issue the wabba devs are aware of and are actively trying to fix.


[9/7/2025 7:14 PM] smallbomb78v
I have this log now, instead of Wabba usually taking me to a link of 'all that's missing' and now I have this error instead, I thought it was about the ba2 thing, but not sure


[9/7/2025 7:15 PM] smallbomb78v
OH WAIT I see a fallout 76 error in the log


[9/7/2025 7:16 PM] han8671
as anyone made vramr work? I tried it but I dont understand the instruction and just ruunning it doesnt work because it doesnt detect the textures

[9/7/2025 7:18 PM] ursorenda
you would not ask about that here. You can google it or ask on their mod page, you can also check the pinned comment made by @Soggy Sandwich to see if it helps


[9/7/2025 7:20 PM] han8671
the pinned comment was too complicated for me, I tought it was like skyrim just run it and itll work but it looks like you need to convert certain textures or idk, I'm lost


[9/7/2025 7:21 PM] ursorenda
one of our beta testers is compiling a guide, until that's completed and we approve official support the best place would be the mod page at this time


[9/7/2025 7:21 PM] han8671
okay


[9/7/2025 7:34 PM] smallbomb78v
ohhh man I think I screwed up, I extracted the zip in the wabba folder, not the 4.0.3.0 thing. and then I deleted all the stuff it put there and now I can't open wabbajack without the exe


[9/7/2025 7:35 PM] ursorenda
reinstall wabba then


[9/7/2025 7:35 PM] smallbomb78v
okay


[9/7/2025 7:51 PM] han8671
is there a way to enable the crosshair?


[9/7/2025 7:57 PM] nomad5157
You can try one of the other huds in FALLUI within the MCM menu or edit the hud directly


[9/7/2025 7:58 PM] nomad5157
Please use fillout. Chat channel is not a support channel. You need to answer to the questions in the form.


[9/7/2025 7:58 PM] smallbomb78v
I chose an install issue but nothing happened


[9/7/2025 7:59 PM] nomad5157
Because you need to fill out the questions and actually submit it

Also! Wanted to say that over all of the wabbajack modlists across Fallout/Skyrim, this is the highest performing one I played. My system is having little to no problems at all playing it.


[9/7/2025 8:34 PM] therhythmz
VRAMr takes around 14 hours to process everything for me. You need to do EXACTLY as it asks you to do when it runs. Only select a drive, do not make the vramr folder inside another folder. Select the drive and let it make a top level folder on its own. Afterwards select the PROFILE folder belonging to the MO2 modpack. Not the mods folder, not the MO2 folder,  not the folder where profiles are stored. Only the specific folder containing the profile to be scanned. Vramr will figure out the rest on its own. In this case if i remember correctly, the folder located inside the "profiles" folder should be called "fallout anomaly beta". That's the one you need to select. If you select ANYTHING ELSE, VRAMr will not know what to do. I downgraded everything to vanilla 512 size, and then further downgraded it to 256 using Cathedral because i have extremely shitty ram and run on integrated graphics on an 11th gen intel i3 with a mere 8gb of ram. If your bottleneck is your texture loading times because of the memory assigned, then the game will stutter a lot especially when drawing mod weapons.


[9/7/2025 8:36 PM] nomad5157
That's great to hear


[9/7/2025 8:37 PM] therhythmz
Also, for the love of god don't make it run on the C: drive. Thats the drive where windows is located, and Windows defender will try to scan everyy single little file VRAMr touches and in the best case scenario your processing time will go up to like 3 days, and in the worst case it will all get deleted as soon as it finishes loading making you do it all over again. Making exceptions on Windows Defender will do nothing. Just DONT DO IT ON C: DRIVE.


[9/7/2025 8:38 PM] martyr.kix
I can agree there. This is super smooth, there are AAA games in less stable conditions than this pack

[9/7/2025 8:39 PM] therhythmz
Right!? It is also beautiful. Its simply incomprehensible how much the lighting edits make the entire game feel different.


[9/7/2025 8:40 PM] therhythmz
Not only that but it even runs better than vanilla FO4 in some areas.


[9/7/2025 8:40 PM] martyr.kix

[9/7/2025 8:42 PM] therhythmz
Yeah i have also potatofied the heck out of the modpack. I uprooted the entire ENB dlls and folders and put NAC X in its place. NAC X runs even better than vanilla lighting engine for some reason.


[9/7/2025 8:42 PM] han8671
I dont have a texture folder in data

Thank you all. If you are enjoying it, please consider leaving a comment on Nexus and giving an endorsement here: https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/74075

We know that some areas may not run perfectly, but we put a lot of effort into making everything as performance-friendly as possible. Hundreds of hours have gone into testing, tweaking, and improving performance. In many cases, problems come from a faulty install or from players not knowing how to get the most out of their system or using really bad programs on your machines or just running your OS into the ground.

With version 0.6 and the new launcher, we are confident that many of these issues will be much easier to fix. Our goal is to make things run more smoothly for everyone, and we truly appreciate all the feedback and support you continue to give.

🔥

[9/7/2025 8:44 PM] therhythmz
That's because theres a missing mod in the mods folder that is still specified in the MO2 profile. VRAMr doesn't scan every single folder on its own. It reads the MO2 profile and getss all the filenames, filepaths and folder structure from there.


[9/7/2025 8:45 PM] han8671
so, whats the solution? I dont really understand how it works


[9/7/2025 8:45 PM] therhythmz
Have you deleted a folder in the mods folder without opening MO2? If not, the profile will still think its there.


[9/7/2025 8:45 PM] han8671

Then there me. I've touched nothing. All the default settings are in place apart from a custom filter, keybinds and sound aesthetics. Having it limited to 120 is a life saver for my gpu, I do not want to run that in overtime 24/7

Hey folks, generally speaking, is now a good time to get back into the modpack? I leave for boot camp in a little under a month, and I'd love the hardcore stuff, but if it's too broken or doesn't quite have its identity yet, I might have to check in after I get a PC again when stationed.


[9/8/2025 4:32 AM] arollingkino
I'm unsure about making a support ticket about this but. Upon installation, every mod functionality seems to be fine, made it out of vault 111 to be sure, no crashes or display issues, but everything is uncolored and unshaded. ENB install issue? Got the proper version and went about installing it as the guide suggested. Any ideas?


[9/8/2025 4:32 AM] ursorenda
first, props for enlisting man. 

the mod pack isn't broken, just unbalanced. very few crashes reported and even then, the majority of reported crashes come from playthroughs that are many hours deep. 

0.6.0 isn't imminent, you'd be fine to start your playthrough now


[9/8/2025 4:33 AM] ursorenda
some users get an overwrite bug that, instead of overwriting/omitting writes it just deletes things. MO2, saves, profiles, etc. It's a best practice type thing, just because you haven't fallen vitcim doesn't mean the bug doesn't exist.


[9/8/2025 4:34 AM] ursorenda
reinstall. If that doesn't fix it, please create a support ticket


[9/8/2025 4:34 AM] butcherofblaviken8
Fair enough


[9/8/2025 4:36 AM] arollingkino
This is upon 2nd install, to my ability following the guide correctly. Both times ended up looking like that but running and functioning fine.


[9/8/2025 4:36 AM] ursorenda
it's whatever you have set to bash, default is left alt

Hello!


[9/8/2025 9:24 AM] malfas.infandum
Goooood day everyone, was super late when I ran into this. Realised that when I put a gas mask on, the screen gets really dark, is this an mcm setting I can change, or is this a problem?


[9/8/2025 9:43 AM] tiburse
There is an MCM setting


[9/8/2025 9:43 AM] tiburse
I believe it's under the radiation mod under survival. Sadly I'm away from home and can't check at the moment.


[9/8/2025 9:49 AM] blurryfaceandrew
okay so iv been trying all the fallout 4 modlists and pretty much all of them have sucked  except Anomoly. Only thing  is i realllyyyy struggle with the UI expecially the pipboy,


[9/8/2025 9:52 AM] blurryfaceandrew
and the crafting ui ,like there seems to be mod settings mixed in with the workbench ui,same with pipboy theirs mod settings to change values in the character stats page when youd think they be separate


[9/8/2025 10:00 AM] lateralus9290
It's in the 'Damn apocalypse' setting. I turned it off as it made my head hurt trying to squint to see stuff.


[9/8/2025 10:00 AM] malfas.infandum
THAAAAAAANK YOUUUUUU


[9/8/2025 10:33 AM] jrkcsnake
Update: I’ve made it to level 12 , this mod pack is hard but man does it feel satisfying when you solve a fight, the way the skills have been implemented is awesome , you can feel the power of your character progress. Companions are life saviors I love you storyteller. Look forward to playing more.


[9/8/2025 10:40 AM] .casualcowboy
Thanks brother!, im looking forward to it! Last time I played i downloaded a mod that removed all legendary items and enemies with the exception of unique weapons, would that further fuck up the balance?


[9/8/2025 11:15 AM] vextin
Leave legendaries in. They're very well balanced in this pack. The legendary enemies aren't very tanky, and legendaries can be scrapped for legendary microchips which can, in turn, be used to craft specific legendary mods.


[9/8/2025 11:16 AM] .casualcowboy
affirm, where does the balance fall short?


[9/8/2025 11:17 AM] vextin
What?


[9/8/2025 11:17 AM] vextin
Like in the pack, what ISNT balanced?


[9/8/2025 11:19 AM] .casualcowboy
i have no clue, but if you read through the conversation i was replying to you'd have context for my question


[9/8/2025 11:24 AM] vextin
Ah, right. Just in general balance needs some love. Armor, ive found, has stats that are just kinda all over the place.


[9/8/2025 11:25 AM] vextin
There are too many ammo variants, and I don't think that damage relies on caliber as much as it should


[9/8/2025 11:25 AM] vextin
At least in my experience, melee does almost nothing


[9/8/2025 11:26 AM] .casualcowboy
affirm, still more of the gun doing damage then the bullet?


[9/8/2025 11:26 AM] vextin
But it's still an enjoyable time, balance is not negatively impacting my enjoyment of the pack


[9/8/2025 11:27 AM] vextin
As far as I can tell, yes. My 9mm, 10mm, 12.7, and .45ACP handguns are all roughly the same damage.


[9/8/2025 11:27 AM] vextin
7.62×54R and .308 also appear to be roughly the same


[9/8/2025 11:28 AM] vextin
That could be me missing something though


[9/8/2025 11:29 AM] .casualcowboy
well those are ballistically the same cartridge with extremely similar performance with 308 being very very slightly better at longer ranges


[9/8/2025 11:31 AM] vextin
They're three whole millimeters apart!! /s


[9/8/2025 11:37 AM] .casualcowboy
i want you to read through my message and digest it fully,


[9/8/2025 11:37 AM] vextin

:awkward_smile:


[9/8/2025 11:54 AM] martyr.kix
They feel very vanilla fallout. Calibers of low grain still do bad damage and fall off massively mid game


[9/8/2025 12:03 PM] martyr.kix
My SSG shreds everything rocking 556 with the rounds that deal bleed. But my legendary incendiary. 38 is pure trash now. Granted I've leveled into crafting rather than damage perks it wouldn't make too much of a difference.


[9/8/2025 12:19 PM] tiburse

[9/8/2025 12:19 PM] .casualcowboy
i still find damage perks a crazy concept, but being fair to the pack authors, i don't think they're seeking realism but a hardcore experience, which is still hype


[9/8/2025 12:24 PM] tiburse
Yea plus those damage perks are mostly baked into vanilla fallout

Did it finish the download of files?


[9/8/2025 12:32 PM] tiburse
If so and its stuck there, sounds like wabba being wabba (partially why we are moving to our own launcher). If so just try starting the process over. Wabba will see the files that are already downloaded and just verify them.

Wabba also doesn't like threaded cores. I'll have all 24 running with no other processes and it still throws itself into 1 download at a time

[9/8/2025 12:40 PM] martyr.kix
Knowing my luck it's probably something with the bios. I do have my cpu and gpu on a small overclock

Spent a good week fixing my last attempt-


[9/8/2025 12:41 PM] ursorenda
No it’s a thing we need to remove, IIRC it’s baked into a patch


[9/8/2025 12:42 PM] ursorenda
Did you disable core isolation in window settings?


[9/8/2025 12:43 PM] ursorenda
In this particular instance it’s an issue with the specific version of wabba, the devs are aware.

Inspired by Metro 2033, this mod implements a new resource: gas mask filters. Humans are required to wear a gas mask while wandering the wasteland in exterior areas. Meanwhile gas masks consume filter

Running into an issure during installation.

> 00:03:21.964 [ERROR] (Wabbajack.InstallationVM) Can't find game Fallout76|System.Exception: Can't find game Fallout76

I see a couple other people have mentioned this, but I'm not seeing the solution. 

I've restarted my PC. Opened Fallout 4 to load screen. Reset Wabbajack. Created a new install folder, etc.


[9/8/2025 6:16 PM] nomad5157

[9/8/2025 6:54 PM] ursorenda
doctor, or if you're on the most recent release you can use a cleansing tonic


[9/8/2025 6:58 PM] martyr.kix
I managed just scrape through with organ failure, weakness, brittle bones, lithium lung and muscle failure.  From that point on I make sure I never leave the radiation poisoning too long. It is a save point ender for sure.


[9/8/2025 6:58 PM] han8671
The game crashed but next time I'll play I'll spawn a cleansing tonic


[9/8/2025 7:00 PM] martyr.kix
You can craft them and they cost 300 caps a pop

I did the background that gives you animal training or pacification or whatever. I thought it would allow you to roam around with Dogmeat and mole rats and radroaches just fucking shit up but so far it doesn't seem to do much.

[9/8/2025 10:42 PM] malfas.infandum
I submitted this ticket, just wanted to let you all know. It was caused by equipping the double barrel shotgun that I modified to have glow sights, bruiser barrel, and I believe the powerful burst mod. Did not realise that it was labelled as double barrel shotgun sub machine gun aha, probably should have known it was going to be jank XD technolgia

I have not noticed this, but I do spend most time outside and have plenty of cigarettes to spare, so I rarely sleep. I try to avoid sleeping whenever possible because I keep getting sick half the time, even when sleeping in my own bed that is indoors in my settlement.

It should be near the overseers desk. However you can get a pistol in the sanctuary manhole outside of red rocket

[9/9/2025 1:28 PM] dragonpalm
but I haven't touched VATs since ADS was introduced after FO3


[9/9/2025 1:29 PM] nomad5157
You can turn vanilla vats back on in the vafs mcm menu but a lot of people dont seem to know this


[9/9/2025 1:30 PM] nomad5157
there is quite a bit of reported bugs that has no response on so seeing how much it's worth to the community to actually keep


[9/9/2025 1:30 PM] dragonpalm

[9/9/2025 1:32 PM] dragonpalm
I'll pick VAFs just cause if we go back to VATs I'd continue never using it lol

[9/9/2025 1:39 PM] therhythmz
Tbh VATS is too underpowered for the gameplay of Anomaly. VAFS fits it much better. VATS has too high of a miss chance, leaving you exposed, and you just die lmao. Its better to do it yourself.

Man its way easier to miss on vats lmao. Shooting heads yourself on slomo is way better. Higher kill potential in a single use if you got good aim.

[9/9/2025 1:42 PM] therhythmz
I already voted for VAFS 👍🏻


[9/9/2025 1:43 PM] dragonpalm
I've always found VATs to be super cheesy lol. The ability to pause the game and have your character shoot for you completely takes me out of the immersion. I'd much rather aim myself and shoot myself over pausing the game and letting the game do it for me.


[9/9/2025 1:43 PM] dragonpalm
I used it in FO3 a lot because hip fire is gross but once ADS was in NV I never bothered with VATs again

Hi guys! Trying to fresh install and im getting an error "cant find game fallout76"

Yeah. It completely takes skill out of the equation, replacing it with pure chance. It can either kill everyone first try or leave you hanging with no AP when it fails.

is there any other ways to save other than cigarettes and sleeping?

Always smells like orange chicken on this job site


[9/9/2025 2:11 PM] nomad5157
The list is made to be played in survival only. There are surival packs that you can make that act just like cigarettes in terms of saving. Those are your only options


[9/9/2025 2:22 PM] belliottt
Yeah I get that, was just curious if there were other items as well. Cheers


[9/9/2025 2:23 PM] nomad5157
Just those options for now


[9/9/2025 2:32 PM] lateralus9290
This. I've not used it once (dont even know the key and wasn't aware it's in the game at all). It's mainly due to using long range scopes so I dont get to use it anyway. Is it tied to AP or is it like a meter that builds up?


[9/9/2025 2:44 PM] quizzy317
I would like to use VAFS more but I play a stealthy sniper glass cannon character that's almost always crouched lol so I almost never have any AP available.


[9/9/2025 2:54 PM] sis783
am i being dumb...  the read me says "You’ll want to pay special attention to your S.P.E.C.I.A.L. distribution, things are a little bit different in Anomaly. Check the User Guide (Under Construction) for more info. " 
where is that at? I have been playing anomaly for a few days but i feel i just dont know core gamplay enough and id like to educate myself on it so i can enjoy all that is offered.


[9/9/2025 2:55 PM] dragonpalm
*there's supposed to be a sort of gameplay guide but when I originally checked I don't think it had been written/published yet*


[9/9/2025 2:56 PM] ursorenda
still under construction. The information contained fluctuates faster than I can moderate and I got tired of how often it was wrong :p


[9/9/2025 2:56 PM] ursorenda
It will be released alongside 0.6.0 and the launcher


[9/9/2025 2:57 PM] dragonpalm
have you thought about launching a community wiki that players can edit? Then people can add things as they find them, if they're dedicated


[9/9/2025 2:58 PM] sis783
oof... ok thanks. Any suggestions or easily missed things? Like i know theres alot here. i understand the healing mechanics now, and im getting a feel for how skills work. gameplay is fun but i die soooo often. i feel im not taking advantage of suff that i might not even know exists.


[9/9/2025 2:59 PM] ursorenda
when the user guide is launched and I can confirm it's accuracy by way of player feedback I plan to use that as a starting point for a wiki.


[9/9/2025 3:00 PM] dragonpalm
could start it now and then just overwrite it with the user guide when .06 comes out 👀


[9/9/2025 3:04 PM] ursorenda
Grenades (in their current implementation) penetrate walls. It's not an intended feature but one you can use to your advantage in tight spaces, especially tight spaces with verticality. get a sense for their range, though. There is no damage drop off. 

For the most part, damage and armor penetration are determined by caliber. That's why pistols kinda just bounce off super mutants without heavy perk and point investment. 

You can adjust how many companions you have *and* how they behave in the AFT Master control. I always set dogmeat's combat AI to "near me" so he isn't just luring enemies to me/dying needlessly. Setting your human companions to medium will cause them to keep their distance from you *and* the enemy whenever possible, which leads to them living longer and providing better fire support. You *generally* don't have to equip them, they act like NPCs and will pick up the highest damage item they can find ammo for. If you set them to not use ammo in AFT they'll just pick up the highest dps item, I wouldn't recommend that because they aren't smart enough to know not to fire a fat man inside a building.


[9/9/2025 3:05 PM] ursorenda
also, chems are *wildly* over powered. To the point they can make melee builds viable. Try em out but keep addictol on you when you do becuase the drawbacks are equally heavy


[9/9/2025 3:08 PM] sis783
Thanks! Also i have a sugestion. its very simple and it might affect survival gameplay alot. Something that might have been overlooked? In workshop creation you can build a sink and water fountain, its from the vault dlc maybe? anyway its bassically free purified water. Not sure if thats wanted to core gameplay but disabling it or changing it to dirty water might not be too hard idk...


[9/9/2025 3:08 PM] ursorenda
it's a work around till we get to fix the problem with water purifiers only giving dirty water atm


[9/9/2025 3:11 PM] sis783
ok just thought id say something. One last thing sorry to keep bothering you! i noticed a dark light around me in the distance and beyound that everything is more sunny. Its like beyound that range it stops rendering light properly. Is this an enb issue? is there supposed to be fog or something and its not showing up for me and thats the range of the fog that i normally wouldnt see? I have no clue what its suppose to look like normally so i dont know if thats normal or if im experiencing an issue....

Check the enb settings in game and see if 'cloud shadow' option is on. If it is, turn it off. That fixed the issue for me.

hey could someone please help me i am trying to find name of a mod that overhauls the icons and it is used by gamma


[9/9/2025 5:40 PM] maxek
i want to use it for my own modpack for anomaly


[9/9/2025 6:29 PM] therhythmz
Anomaly probably already has all the icons you're talking about. Changing the style of icons is done through MCM, not by installing new ones. There are several different styles already included in Anomaly. That being said, the best one is the one already selected because its the one that matches things in anomaly. I suggest only changing the style and not trying to change the icon pack.

[9/9/2025 6:52 PM] han8671
is a save file 1-2min before dying good enough or do you want one 5-7mins before dying? I dont know if you need alot of time.

You'll like my save, its like 1min-1min30 before dying, it's before Piper's dialogue at diamond city's gate and I die when she speaks to me/when the gates open

[9/9/2025 9:38 PM] sis783
I cant find it. I dont remeber the item name but its something like cdpa or wierd like that. Look for a medical item that says it lowers ira and cures radiation poisoning.


[9/9/2025 9:39 PM] sis783
it can be made at a chem station at like medicine skill 25 i think

Try the 4.0.3.0 version as listed in the fix above. Different error I know but worth a shot while my brain boots up. I just woke up.

Wait if I could read the directory thats the version you were already using.

Anyone tried using the Soviet shotgun? (KS23 basically). I found a legendary one, but it shows dmg as 8. I do not have any ammo for it so I couldn't test if it's just tickling enemies or if the UI is just showing the number incorrectly.


[9/10/2025 9:32 AM] lord_farquaad3911
yes using 4.03.0 Let me see about defender!


[9/10/2025 9:33 AM] tiburse
Sometimes defender throws "false positives" and stops instals from working properly.


[9/10/2025 9:33 AM] tiburse
Ive been running into an issue with it myself while trying to run an optimization program haha.


[9/10/2025 9:34 AM] nomad5157
Those numbers are sometimes off. Damage is based off the caliber and not the weapon itself. Some weapons act weird

I am expecting the first few episodes to be a bit dry and filled with tons of critiques on what works and what doesn't. I like the concepts in this list but there are a lot of additional items that aren't necessary and make the list unstable in my view. So...

[9/10/2025 3:38 PM] ursorenda
yes,  you would use the search function built into discord to see if the solution has already been found and explained.

[9/10/2025 5:15 PM] sis783
Ive noticed some perks mention vafs and some mention vats. Do the ones that mention vats not work with vafs or do they work just maybe like differently? Same with weapon modifications. Example the assault pistol has a modification that says it increases accuracy in vats. Is that useless? If it does work with vafs how does that translate? Just an increase in the guns accuracy stat?


[9/10/2025 5:16 PM] ursorenda
VAFs is built on top of the VATs backend systems, anything that affects one affects the other. The only variation is that accuracy is a mixed bag in VAFs


[9/10/2025 5:18 PM] ursorenda
also anything that affects the AP drain for VAFs will not affect any static drain on VATs, or at least it shouldn't. Per shot drain is shared, damage is shared, percent chance to cripple is shared. 

Basically everything but the two I mentioned are shared


[9/10/2025 5:19 PM] sis783
Thanks was holding off on certain perks because I wasn't sure.


[9/10/2025 5:46 PM] picoday
Hey is there a reason why the wabbajack installer would be saying an error only because I don't have Fallout76 installed? Is that an actual requirement?

Is there a reason .45 does less damage than 9mm? Its a gun nerd thing thats driving me crazy. Tell me to shut up about it and I will but I just found a 1911 in game and it does less damage than a 9mm and its making me sad. 🤣

Aww I guess there aren’t a lot of workshops stuff mods in the modlist 🙁 it okay


[9/11/2025 12:02 AM] therhythmz
I just deleted everything and went to download Anomaly again since id like to be a bit more helpful. I pulled the trigger and paid for Nexus. Man my index finger is already thanking me lmao. No more clicking 972 times 🤣


[9/11/2025 12:14 AM] ursorenda
Thanks to the extensive testing done by @Ally_J I can inform you that the vast majority of workshop mods are compatible. Add what you'd like, just avoid anything that's script heavy (SS2, for example)


[9/11/2025 12:14 AM] ursorenda
it really is a godsend if you've ever manually installed a whole modlist before


[9/11/2025 12:15 AM] therhythmz
Ive done it with anomaly like 5 times already lmao. My index finger has washboard abs by now.


[9/11/2025 12:22 AM] therhythmz
Im have ADHD and only have a 500 gig ssd. I got excited when i saw the new stalker modpack that starts with a G got an update and had to play that for a bit, then wanted to go back to FO anomaly (there really isn't anything like this modpack out there. Irreplaceable. It just hits different), then i saw that Anthology 2.0 OBT was out so i freed up space to play that one, made a patch for an issue on the english dub for cutscenes, then came back to FO anomaly, and counting the times i reinstalled to see if i could make it run even better, so 5 times sounds about right lol.


[9/11/2025 12:49 AM] avsanchez101
Guys, how do I use it? Q and E like STALKER ?


[9/11/2025 12:49 AM] avsanchez101
because i push Q and E not work


[9/11/2025 12:55 AM] therhythmz
There's a mod called Uneducated Shooter. You need to enable it ONLY after you leave vault 111


[9/11/2025 12:56 AM] cartjon1
Why am i CONSTANTLY getting radiation poison haha. I keep using the radiation poison remover and it just immediately comes back. They are hard to find/make


[9/11/2025 12:57 AM] therhythmz
If you enable it earlier, it has a dynamic actor height framework that will make you clip through the floor of the elevator. It mostly only happens with that elevator though, and only happens sometimes. But you'll be stuck on an endless falling loop until you quit the game and disable the mod.


[9/11/2025 12:59 AM] therhythmz
There are two types of radiation in Anomaly. RADs (the normal ones) and IRAs. The second one has no visible feedback. You need to use a tool in your inventory called RadBoy. It accumulates by eating any kind of food that gives rads. You can only remove it with RadAway if i recall correctly.


[9/11/2025 12:59 AM] cartjon1
OH


[9/11/2025 12:59 AM] cartjon1
So thats why the IRA will not go away despite radiation removers


[9/11/2025 12:59 AM] cartjon1
awesome thanks.


[9/11/2025 12:59 AM] cartjon1
And all food seems to be really bad for you.


[9/11/2025 12:59 AM] therhythmz
Cook everything. Dont eat it if it gives you RADs.


[9/11/2025 1:00 AM] cartjon1
I cant even cook radroach meat haha


[9/11/2025 1:00 AM] cartjon1
I need to level up survival skill to unlock more recipes right?


[9/11/2025 1:01 AM] therhythmz
Also, ambient exposure to really high RADs is supposed to slowly give you IRAs eventually too, so be careful of getting too much regular RADs. Always carry Rad-X or other stuff that gives resistance.


[9/11/2025 1:02 AM] therhythmz
Yes.


[9/11/2025 1:02 AM] martyr.kix
You are mad. I couldn't do that for the life of me 🤣


[9/11/2025 1:02 AM] cartjon1
Okay that makes sense. I think i keep exposing myself. I need to find that wasteland armor that gives like 40 rad resistance


[9/11/2025 1:03 AM] therhythmz
Yes i know. But i think i find messing with programs more entertaining than actually playing lmao.


[9/11/2025 1:03 AM] cartjon1
I just took a THIRD IRA remover and have lithium lung again immediately


[9/11/2025 1:03 AM] martyr.kix
Assault gasmasks are great for airborne rads. 800 resistance and very common drops


[9/11/2025 1:03 AM] cartjon1
So i must need radaway!


[9/11/2025 1:03 AM] cartjon1
Oh ty so much martyr


[9/11/2025 1:04 AM] martyr.kix
Just try not shoot anyone in the head who has them otherwise you will break it


[9/11/2025 1:05 AM] avsanchez101
Where can I find this text?


[9/11/2025 1:05 AM] therhythmz
Yep. The only reliable way of getting rid of IRAs is radaway, which is hard to find in Anomaly. That being said, if i recall correctly, some loot in Anomaly is location sensitive. If you go to Cambridge you are bound to find more medical stuff due to the hospital nearby.


[9/11/2025 1:05 AM] martyr.kix
I've attempted in the past even done my code. I can confidently say I prefer leaving the super technical stuff to the boys that enjoy it lmao


[9/11/2025 1:06 AM] therhythmz
I think its under the Optional tab in MO2.


[9/11/2025 1:06 AM] martyr.kix
To add to this there is a place just outside of fort hagen that supplies a good amount of healing items


[9/11/2025 1:07 AM] avsanchez101

Okay im going to make a trip to cambridge then. Im working on being able to craft these medical items too


[9/11/2025 1:07 AM] martyr.kix
Yessir. Should be right at the top of optional mods


[9/11/2025 1:08 AM] therhythmz
Yes. Start your game, create your character, leave vault 111, then close the game and enable the mod. This is so you can avoid falling through the elevator.

Food and drink now give IRA instead of normal rads

Your better of keeping to cooked food and purified water when possible


[9/11/2025 1:55 AM] martyr.kix
However cleansing tonics will cure radtionation poisoning and CDIs will drop both RADs and IRA

i just be lurking watching you wrangle some of the goofiest questions ive ever seen. it is entertaining tho.


[9/11/2025 5:18 PM] murdock45
suppose that is the nature of modpacks


[9/11/2025 5:19 PM] ursorenda
perspective and perception are applicable in introspective and extrospective ways, failure to apply the latter will make loads of things look goofy.


[9/11/2025 5:20 PM] ursorenda
which is an insufferable way of saying "yeah I just try not to be elitist about it" :p


[9/11/2025 5:21 PM] murdock45
those who can do, those who cant download mod packs and ask questions. i will say the learning curb on the pack is pretty steep imo. needing help is inevitable. luckily for me all my questions have been answered via the search bar.


[9/11/2025 5:21 PM] murdock45
this list is far and beyond anything i could come up with myself.


[9/11/2025 5:22 PM] ursorenda
not everyone knows how to use keywords in search. Also it's learning curve* :p

Yeah our devs are absolute autists. I wish I could show you what they're working on rn it'd blow your fuckin mind

[9/11/2025 5:25 PM] ursorenda
I think a lot of people are interested in it because of how it handles settlements


[9/11/2025 5:25 PM] ursorenda
also does a lot of customizing areas in ways that make a lot of sense, realism wise

my only gripe with anomaly is the rad storms and the convoluted "craft a bench so you can craft another bench" but thats just skill issue.


[9/11/2025 5:31 PM] ursorenda
yeah ECO is being removed. I'd say I used my veto power to get it removed but the devs all agreed lol


[9/11/2025 5:32 PM] ursorenda
rad storms need  to be tuned


[9/11/2025 5:32 PM] murdock45

worth checking the https://discord.com/channels/1113971680419782666/1390587937627963432 and verifying you've covered all of the prerequisites as well. Most commonly overlooked is the pagefile (which can cause that generalized memory error)

I remember trying to play frost back when I first started doing modding for fallout. Promising however I massively butchered the manual install and well yeah.

But this just gives you everything on a plate and the work you have to additionally do is bare minimum and simple.

like this


[9/11/2025 8:12 PM] therhythmz
Screenshot wont load, but I'm guessing those are IRAs. Ingested radiation levels. They go up when you eat food that gives rada and will slowly get out of hand. Can only be removed with Radaway basically. You need to cook absolutely everything. Canned food is deadly in Anomaly.


[9/11/2025 8:12 PM] please_be_patient
oooh, that makes sense


[9/11/2025 8:13 PM] therhythmz
Only eat irradiated food in extreme emergencies, as Radaway is fairly scarce in Anomaly.


[9/11/2025 8:13 PM] please_be_patient
is it still called radaway? i know some items got renamed

[9/11/2025 9:51 PM] ursorenda
it's all damn apocalypse, but we changed the system from what it says on the mod page


[9/11/2025 9:51 PM] ursorenda
90% of it boils down to either IRAs or RADs being too high and catching rad poisoning


[9/11/2025 9:57 PM] mu6dv6ay6ne
Ah okay. Thanks. So curing the RADs and IRA will cure those? 

And the healing is the same as the mod page?

idk if this is a bug or what but i just crafted like 30 bottles and they disappeared from my inventory. so i reloaded my save and did the 10x bottle option and they showed up fine so i  reloaded the save again and crafted one at a time and they were gone from my inventory again.

I downloaded a bunch of settlement/building mods and it’s stable, can’t wait to get home and start rebuilding the commonwealth


[9/12/2025 11:47 AM] rfgaergaerg
sim settlements 2 by any chance?


[9/12/2025 11:47 AM] malfas.infandum
That mod was removed, not compatible anymore and/or too script heavy I believe.

Anyone noticed Heather not being affected by thermal goggles? I tried to modify her outfit but left the default one, and she is no longer highlighted. Not sure If it's a expected (to no highlight followers now) or not.


[9/12/2025 12:19 PM] nomad5157
She’s not a vanilla follower. Completely different systems. Mod author would need to make a patch

Anyone know how to get power armor training? Is it a specific perk or do I have to run some of the BoS quests to unlock it


[9/12/2025 1:36 PM] junky_89
Hi! I'm trying to port the maps from anthology 2.0 (they look AMAZING) to anomlay/gamma. I could have "some" kind of success, and load the maps+textures, but having a lot of problems with spawns, configs, some errors. I have 0 experience modding anomaly... Anyone tried this? Or some project? Someone maybe with map experience?


[9/12/2025 2:00 PM] shoudaix
Excuse me sir this is Fallout 4

Fill out the form at the link at the top of the support channel


[9/12/2025 2:52 PM] ursorenda
You need to create a support ticket. Don’t use general chat as a help desk, please


[9/12/2025 2:53 PM] ursorenda
Any faction that uses power armor as a main stay has a trainer


[9/12/2025 3:04 PM] lmaodead
I did now. Not sure what's wrong with my game.


[9/12/2025 3:10 PM] lmaodead
The game seems fine for the first 2 minutes of booting it up, but then it bugs out and starts auto looting and auto entering the workbench menu. I made a report, but I can't really enjoy the modlist.


[9/12/2025 3:16 PM] seaworth2283
You have to find the training manuals I don’t remember the name of the mod


[9/12/2025 3:17 PM] ursorenda
Incorrect, you need to find an npc to train you. The holotapes only increase your performance *after* receiving PA training

[9/12/2025 3:21 PM] ursorenda
General chat is not a help desk, I will create a thread and we can discuss it there


[9/12/2025 3:21 PM] lmaodead
Alright. Thank you.


[9/12/2025 3:34 PM] ursorenda
you're not really supposed to find any pistols due to the YAE background system


[9/12/2025 3:35 PM] ursorenda
you will gain armorsmithing *as* you level tinkering. It comes at intervals of 25


[9/12/2025 3:35 PM] shoudaix
I thought the Anomaly MCM preset is set to have 0 background choices? Cause I can tag 3 skills, choose 2 traits but 0 backgrounds


[9/12/2025 3:37 PM] ursorenda
that's a bug :p 

You should have one background point


[9/12/2025 3:38 PM] shoudaix
Oh, should I try fixing it in MCM or what's the go to 😅 (or move this to another channel)


[9/12/2025 3:42 PM] ursorenda
small stuff like this is fine, unfortunately if you missed the window the only fix is to restart your game. You can also try reloading the start save if you start a new game and it doesn't proc the background point.

If it consistently fails to give you the background point please create a support ticket


[9/12/2025 3:42 PM] shoudaix
Alright


[9/12/2025 6:42 PM] kingseabass9922

[9/12/2025 7:28 PM] vextin
Or so, yeah


[9/12/2025 8:47 PM] blurryfaceandrew
Kinda disappointing this modlist really doesn’t add any knew content like quest or locations


[9/12/2025 8:49 PM] nomad5157
It does?


[9/12/2025 8:50 PM] blurryfaceandrew
Ehh, it was just disappointing to me because the foundational stuff this modlist accomplishes is better then most fallout 4 modlist by far. I know it’s still beta so mabye more will be added ?


[9/12/2025 8:53 PM] nomad5157
Yes there will be more in 0.6

[9/12/2025 9:17 PM] lufaine
tried xedit all relevant files (mostly just the overwrites in m8r's sorter) and making new entries in the true dmg robco patcher, but only seems to have worked for a few round types while most are still disfunctional

It's a bug with a weapon mod that mod author has not fixed yet


[9/12/2025 10:33 PM] therhythmz
Just in case you're still in the server, Anthology, and gamma, have their certain way of scripting dialogue, quests and scripting which are tied to events and spawns. They were basically completely redone and take full advantage of the A-life system. When you set spawns, its not a steady respawn for that creature or NPC. That's a scripted spawn and needs to be tied to a trigger. If what you want is for certain entities to spawn, you need to tie them to A-life and set a population, squad size, and all the rest of things, including some form of population control like periodical culling or resets. If you dont, you'll overpopulate your map and crash the game and break saves because Stalker Anomaly has a limit for everything, even for items. 

That being said, this is the wrong server. You can add me, or you can find me sometimes on Anthology OBT english translation thread. Im the dude that made the fix for the cutscene audio. AlzHighMr is also a nice guy, but i think he hamdles translation exclusively. There are othere folks on the extra mods thread that might be able to help, especially those regarding extra mutants. Have a good day/night, lets resume this conversation somewhere else uwu

When i mod my own lists i always make sure to lower all my true damage ammo patches as low as i can. I also exclude them from sorting on m8r complex sorter. Since they dont add items, excluding them does no harm. If you dont exclude them they will become masters for the m8r complex sorter plugin and you wont be able to load them under it. That seems to solve all true damage ammo issues for me 99.9% of the time.


[9/13/2025 3:45 AM] ursorenda
tough customer, geez


[9/13/2025 3:46 AM] ursorenda
it's a bug overlooked in favor of larger bugs. should be fixed by 0.6.0


[9/13/2025 3:47 AM] ursorenda
look in the various "Anomaly" patches, I can't remember which but one contains an amalgamation of the various damage affecting edits.


[9/13/2025 3:48 AM] ursorenda
it's like... 89% certain that it's caused by a conflict between the few enclave mods, we just haven't had the spare priority to take a look

hello people i last played this modpack last year in december how much did change? also are there any perfomance improvments i remember not having the best perfomance last time


[9/13/2025 4:05 AM] caymiss
all good, the modpack is great. it was just interesting others had the same experience

8276_Cool_Finger_Guns

[9/13/2025 4:23 AM] ursorenda
I'm careful about saying we've made performance improvements. 

We hear from loads of folks that our modpack is the most stable they've ever played, but there are a select few who still get FPS drop and performance stutter. 

We did add an extensive previs deployment that *should* dramatically improve performance. My recommendation would be to try it out. we can try to help you get performance up to snuff if you run into any major issues.


[9/13/2025 4:24 AM] tiburse
Biggest help I found is adjusting SBAO and DoF settings in the ENB menu.


[9/13/2025 4:25 AM] tiburse
Im here, just feel like death haha.


[9/13/2025 4:26 AM] dasmathebuch420
i did upgrade my system to a 5700x3d and a 9060XT so im a bit more confident were there any major changes in the gameplay loop?


[9/13/2025 4:27 AM] ursorenda
I wasn't a part of the community last december so I'm not the best person to ask. I'm gonna lean towards: probably major changes


[9/13/2025 4:28 AM] ursorenda
the modpack, as I understand it, has gone through about 6 major overhauls, I believe the last of which was in the last year. As far as the core gameplay loop, if you remember MAIM, Damn Apocalypse, and/or True Damage it may not be too far off. otherwise, it's probably gonna be a bit more punishing


[9/13/2025 9:18 AM] dasmathebuch420
thank you i just bought premium so i might try it out


[9/13/2025 10:13 AM] _ogjt
with the LPVO's are we able to change the magnification level?

How many shots in the head from a kimber are the zombies when you enter Concord supposed to be tanking? Just making sure everything works as intended

[9/13/2025 11:18 AM] yami_ger

Gonna be honest, not a clue. I leave that mod off personally. It drives me batty.

Did ya ass any other mods maybe


[9/13/2025 3:10 PM] lateralus9290
I disabled that mod and it's gone. But I didnt see anything in the mod details that would create some kind of counter. Guess I'll stick to vanilla leaning for now.

Weird could also be mods  beibg mods

I forget which that is but it’s a troubleshooting tool activated with one of the num keys (IIRC)


[9/13/2025 4:00 PM] ursorenda
If you didn’t apply the MCM preset thatll happen. They aren’t supposed to have single digit damage values. If you applied the preset then start a new game and see if it changes. If not, create a support ticket


[9/13/2025 4:00 PM] ursorenda
Dunno what that is but I know that there’s only one weapon with variable zoom and it has an MCM menu to bind the key

It goes in the downloads folder as the zip file it is. When wabba runs the install it goes installed with the rest in the correct load order.

Hey guys! How does adding something like Sim Settlements break/conflict with mods in this pack?


[9/13/2025 6:53 PM] picoday
(I would prefer to actually use the first Sim Settlements mod, not Sim Settlements 2. I never liked the quests).


[9/13/2025 6:55 PM] tiburse
SS2 is heavily scripted and its not really compatible as it would need many patches made, and our focus is on stability which precludes SS2 (which will add a bunch of save bloat).


[9/13/2025 6:56 PM] tiburse
The comment I replied to is also relevent.


[9/13/2025 6:58 PM] ursorenda
Not so much needs patching, itll work out of the box for the most part. It’s just gonna nuke the longevity of your playthrough


[9/13/2025 7:00 PM] picoday
What about the first Sim settlements mod? The one without all those quests


[9/13/2025 7:12 PM] ursorenda
See previous comment. The added scripts that create and track permanent additions to the world-space are the issue, not the quests


[9/13/2025 7:19 PM] picoday
Ahhh okay. Well fair enough

Last question lol. Would adding a mod that has more prefabs/moduels screw anything up beyond basic patches needed?


[9/13/2025 7:23 PM] ursorenda
If you’re talking about adding buildables to the workshop system, no.

Just be aware that *extensive* building (like fully building out more than half of the settlements) will have the same effect, regardless of whether you’ve added


[9/13/2025 7:28 PM] picoday
So building out roughly more than half of the game's settlement locations will cause 'heavy script' related issues?


[9/13/2025 7:30 PM] ursorenda
No, it will cause save bloat. Give this a read.

Oh! Will do


[9/13/2025 7:32 PM] ursorenda
There are quite a few mods the community at large enjoys that we simply will not include because they cause save bloat. We try to prioritize stability over everything else.


[9/13/2025 7:33 PM] ursorenda
Like i mentioned, though:

you *can* use SS/SS2. just be aware of the affect on save bloat and watch your save file sizes


[9/13/2025 7:34 PM] ursorenda
IIRC there’s a way to un-bloat your save using a cleaner tool but it’s unsupported by our team and I’ve never used it so that’d be a project you’d have to tackle on your own


[9/13/2025 7:55 PM] fred.pja.school.sucks
You can you send a screenshot so I can see the graphics


[9/13/2025 7:57 PM] ursorenda
No. You’ve been hyper vague about your issue and refused to create a support ticket about whatever it is you’re having an issue with. Create a support ticket if you want *any* further assistance


[9/13/2025 8:26 PM] dasmathebuch420
so uh i cant seem to open the vault door cause it says im in combat even tho i killed everything in the vault including the thing in the other cryo room


[9/13/2025 8:27 PM] ursorenda
That’s likely a stuck rad roach. Use console command killall and see if that solves it, otherwise try reloading your save (itll put you back at the cryopod)

If that doesn’t work you can try a new game, after that create a support ticket please


[9/13/2025 8:30 PM] dasmathebuch420
i fixed it by using Player.ScaOnActor

That works as well


[9/13/2025 8:45 PM] lmaodead
Is there a way to enable saves? I can't save unless I sleep. It's kinda getting annoying trying to get anywhere in the beginning and then just die and reset to the vault elevator.


[9/13/2025 8:47 PM] ursorenda
Outside of the vault, cigarettes are how you autosave (only retains the 3 most recent)

If you want to make a save you can *always* go back to you need to craft a survival pack at the chem station


[9/13/2025 8:47 PM] lmaodead
vault cigarettes?


[9/13/2025 8:47 PM] lmaodead

Got it. Thank you.


[9/13/2025 8:48 PM] ursorenda
If you wanna give yourself some cogs to start off with use the mod explorer with forward slash (the key under backspace) and search for cig. The correct ones have [cig] in front of them


[9/13/2025 8:49 PM] ursorenda
Somwtimes you have to mash the mod explorer button a few times to get it to show

Does this modpack disable auto center for recoil or do I gotta disable that myself?

Takes away the challenge, been looking at this modpack and I likey what I see.

[9/14/2025 9:08 AM] picoday
Is it unreasonable to play a more passive character with this mod pack? Or is combat more of a focus when playing the game as opposed to vanilla survival?


[9/14/2025 9:46 AM] the6punisher3
hello, mind anyone help me out, with telling me how to get the "Anti virus" step while having McAfee enabled? (for everyone its this Anti virus app, and iam not able to do it over the Windows anti virus software) so i don't have this "Exclusion" option

thanks in advance 🙂


[9/14/2025 9:51 AM] vextin
Bro McAfee IS A VIRUS


[9/14/2025 9:51 AM] vextin
Get rid of that shit


[9/14/2025 9:51 AM] vextin
Not negotiable


[9/14/2025 9:56 AM] vextin
I'd like to see you try (genuine). Combat is very much a focus but with You Are Exceptional im sure you could build around charisma. It's not New Vegas tho - you're gonna have to kill things to progress quests.


[9/14/2025 9:58 AM] picoday
McAfee is *not* a virus lol


[9/14/2025 9:59 AM] picoday
Oh yes, I'll be trying for sure. I've noticed the intimidation perk or whatever it's called gets rewarded to you in the starting Vault, so I was thinking I could somehow optimize that


[9/14/2025 10:10 AM] vextin

The folder where you installed Anomaly.


[9/14/2025 12:38 PM] therhythmz
@Chicken i second Vex on that one. Get rid of McAfee. Windows Defender has gotten so good over the years that antiviruses are more focused on annoying you to get you to pay than on getting rid of malware. They are basically Adware. The only relatively good ones are Malwarebytes and Kaspersky, and even then i only download them when i suspect an infection, run their targeted scans, do what i need to do, and uninstall them afterwards.


[9/14/2025 12:40 PM] raider216
At least Microsoft does that very well, saves me plenty of money.


[9/14/2025 12:40 PM] therhythmz
Playing as a girl and getting the Black Widow perk makes a lot of conversations trivial in Anomaly. The Charisma Checks are not that high, and that perk mitigates a lot of the downsides that come with Lucky7.


[9/14/2025 12:43 PM] therhythmz
Not "very well" mind you. Its still shidd. The thing most people ignore is that other antiviruses are not much better so getting them is pointless, especially McAfee and Norton. Both of those can even be considered malware lmao. Defender has simply caught up. Only Kaspersky and Malwarebytes run certain scans and have certain protocols, and have much bigger malware recognition databases that other AV software simply don't have.


[9/14/2025 12:44 PM] raider216
Well as long as I avoid downloading porn and suspicious sites, I’m sure I’ll be fine lmao.


[9/14/2025 12:44 PM] raider216
Haven’t had a AV in forever now.


[9/14/2025 12:45 PM] therhythmz
Exactly. Unless you are a person of interest (like a politician or an administrator with access to sensitive stuff), its almost impossible to get viruses just because.


[9/14/2025 12:46 PM] raider216
Indeed.


[9/14/2025 12:46 PM] therhythmz
And even then, if you're targeted, believe me that almost all modern malware with a specific purpose are engineered to fly under the radar no matter your security measures. The only truly secure system is one with an air gap, as in, one that doesn't have and will never have internet. Completely isolated.


[9/14/2025 12:48 PM] therhythmz
Personally, my only real tool against malware is Portmaster. Controls all incoming and outgoing data with really sensitive filtering. You can even blueball all of Microsoft's telemetry bullshidd, including UPnP scans lmao.


[9/14/2025 12:51 PM] therhythmz
You may give me a trojan, but that trojan cant do shidd if it can't give you the data that it stole. Simple as that. It blocks stuff on a per-port basis, and a per-process basis. I only allow my browser and my work stuff through it. Wabbajack uses Edge for downloads if you're interested in trying it. It also gets tied to your boot programs, so nothing can escape when turning your pc off or on.


[9/14/2025 12:52 PM] therhythmz
And also, portmaster has a free version without spam, as they are ran pretty much like a non-profit.

There's also a very weird bug when playing large modlists on fallout. It happens entirely randomly. Fallout seems to simply disable a few keys. It gets fixed by restarting fallout.

[9/14/2025 1:00 PM] therhythmz
Yeah lmao. Its like the key no longer exists. Happened to me with ESC and Ctrl. Even outside the game they dont work. Closing the game and starting it again is the thing that fixes it.


[9/14/2025 1:01 PM] aeafjiafjajofipajofr
i just started the game idk if its the reason


[9/14/2025 1:02 PM] aeafjiafjajofipajofr
and i cant open map nothing


[9/14/2025 1:03 PM] nomad5157
Yeah, McAfee and a lot of those paid antivirus programs usually aren’t worth it anymore. They tend to slow your computer down, push constant pop-ups, and sometimes make basic stuff harder to use. Windows Defender (now called Microsoft Defender) comes built into Windows, so you don’t have to install anything extra, and it runs quietly in the background without nagging you. It updates its virus definitions almost every day through Windows Update, which keeps it current against new threats. Since it’s made by Microsoft, it’s also better integrated with the system and doesn’t eat up as many resources as third-party software. For most people, it’s all you really need as long as you keep Windows updated and practice safe browsing.

[9/14/2025 2:14 PM] raider216
So why is IRA so important in this game if it is just from natural sources like sunlight?


[9/14/2025 2:14 PM] raider216
Granted that the ozone layer would be damaged I suppose due to the nuclear exchange.


[9/14/2025 2:15 PM] raider216
I shoulda paid more attention to science class in a nutshell.


[9/14/2025 2:19 PM] nomad5157
That's not how IRA works in this


[9/14/2025 2:20 PM] raider216
Ah, gotcha.


[9/14/2025 2:20 PM] nomad5157
Radiation module:
Adds a second gameplay layer to the radiation system, for the player only. Radiation now comes twofold: Ingested Radioactive Particles (short: IRA) and Tissue damage from radiation exposure (short: RAD, this is the vanilla RADs you know). Negative IRA values in the PipBoy are "damage": A negative display value will damage the player for that amount, which adds the same amount of IRA to the ActorValue.
Accumulating IRAs will cause a disease-like effect that periodically causes RAD damage to the player. IRA is accumulated from food, water, weather, and other hazards.
Accumulating RADs will cause disease-like radiation poisoning effects that mimic Acute Radiation Poisoning Syndrome.
Radiation medicine is now split into 4 items: RadAway to purge IRAs and cure radiation poisoning; MutAway to heal RADs, Rad-X to increase IRA resistance and Pb-Jelly to increase RAD resistance.
Splits radiation treatment cost for doctors into a small and large service cost, to bring radiation levels mechanically in line with health.
The system provides some degree of inevitability - Radiation, if left completely unchecked, will eventually kill the player. Getting out of the heat does not mean the player is truly safe.
Overhauls plausibility of nuclear technology - Fission powered devices now behave differently than fusion powered devices. In practice this will change behavior of nuclear-related explosions such as nukes and explosions from destroyed robots.
Adds a second layer of hazardousness (RAD & IRA damage) to the weather system. The system is able to detect fake interiors and there is an unlockable settlement object that acts as a fake interior marker. Functional Gas Masks, Hazmat Suits and Power Helmets will protect the player from this.
Makes protective equipment more interesting by making Gas Masks and Hazmat Suits breakable, but necessary to resist hostile weathers and environmental hazards.
Adds an automated player notification system: RadBoy. This is to inform the player of ambient radioactive particles, radiation poisoning and increasingly dangerous IRA accumulation levels. RadBoy can notify you with text messages or voice lines. (see config holotape)
Adds a new set of perk magazines to the Commonwealth: Raider's Digest. Magazines unlock crafting recipes and stand out in any serious magazine collection.


[9/14/2025 2:20 PM] nomad5157
will try to work on updating guide for rad module today also

Guess I figured out why she does not show in the highlight. She does not have a 'body' now. By that I mean that she can no longer be hit by enemies or myself. Guess I'll need to give her some crappy gun with low damage to balance it out. Unless anyone know if this can be reset somehow 😄

appreciate the work you guys do, level 19 and only real one ive seen is glowing enemies breaking my plate, otherwise its been a smooth experience

{Reactions}
❤️

[9/14/2025 4:30 PM] therhythmz
I think that's due to how plate mechanics work. Plate health/durability is counted in instances of damage, and not in a total amount of durability points. They can absorb up to 10 hits or instances of damage before breaking. I'm guessing flamethrowers also deplete plates instantly. Glowing enemies do radiation area damage in a way similar to fire or other things like that which consists of a steady stream of really low value but very fast and constant damage instances. A possible fix is to make electric, rad and poison bypass armor completely. Or if that's something that's already coded, simply include those instances on the bypass. After all, plates are supposed to mitigate kinetic only. Makes no sense to mitigate other types of damage.


[9/14/2025 7:33 PM] aeafjiafjajofipajofr

hello, i already finished downloading the entire modpack, there are just 10 mods that arent done yet, because of this error "Could not be downloaded - Unfortunately, that did not work. Please try again or contact your organization." should i just try to reinstall them? and if yes over Nexus my own or again over wabbajack?

and is the modpack compadative with the we are the minutemen, militarised minutemen, sandbag fortification, and the minutemen patrolm mods?


[9/15/2025 1:50 AM] therhythmz
Use Wabbajack. There should be a Retry button in the lower right corner if you havent closed Wabbajack. Dont worry, it will pick up where it left off.


[9/15/2025 1:59 AM] therhythmz
Anything that touches factions generally has conflicts. All factions have been overhauled with new equipment, weapon loadouts, etc. to take advantage of the massive amount of items and mechanics provided by the pack. And a lot of mods that involve quests are not recommended as they can interfere with events for other things. In general with really complex modpacks like this one, rule of thumb is that you should avoid mods that replace or modify anything, only use those that add things. And even then, anything you add should be carefully placed in the mod order, as high as possible, so it doesn't overwrite anything important.

Welp, i ran wabbajack again, it MD5  verified all the files, it downloaded and fixed what was missing or corrupted, and then... 

It randomly decided to delete Anomaly in its entirety lmao.

Thank god i backed up the things i had made in another folder lol. 

How can Wabbajack be so good, yet so randomly buggy and annoying? Lol. 

Off to another day and a half of downloading, decompressing and installing i guess. Lmao.

Hello I just discovered this modpack/ modlist and was going to give it a try. I did all the preparation steps before clicking the install button, but for some reason after I start the install nothing happens. No files are being downloaded or anything.


[9/15/2025 6:03 AM] the6punisher3
anyone know how to get the game fullscreen again? its all in the left uper corner 🥲


[9/15/2025 6:46 AM] yami_ger
Open bethpie and edit settings there


[9/15/2025 6:47 AM] the6punisher3
where do i find it?


[9/15/2025 7:04 AM] picoday
You can find the executable in MO2. It’s a drop-down option on the far top right


[9/15/2025 7:05 AM] picoday
And then run it just like you’d run the game, but make sure it’s selected


[9/15/2025 7:06 AM] picoday
Have you noticed it giving an immediate error? On the right side, there is a Wabbajack log of sorts. What is the last few things you see?


[9/15/2025 7:31 AM] the6punisher3
I dont have this bethpie, just bethini )


[9/15/2025 7:32 AM] the6punisher3

I mean, low graphics in bethini.


[9/15/2025 1:38 PM] aeafjiafjajofipajofr
i didn't change the quality settings i dont know where i can change


[9/15/2025 1:40 PM] therhythmz
Ah then you skipped a bit in the setup guide. To adjust settings you need to open Bethini as stated above. Unless you know what you're doing, i suggest sticking with graphical Bethini presets (dont use vanilla presets).


[9/15/2025 1:42 PM] aeafjiafjajofipajofr
oh my bad


[9/15/2025 1:43 PM] aeafjiafjajofipajofr
i launch bethini in mo2?


[9/15/2025 1:43 PM] aeafjiafjajofipajofr
ok no in the files


[9/15/2025 1:44 PM] aeafjiafjajofipajofr
im on bethini preset


[9/15/2025 1:45 PM] therhythmz
I'm asking because theres a bug where if shadow resolution is lower or has a weird value different than a number on the power of 2 (256, 512, 1024, 2048, etc) or if shadow splits or filtering are either lower than a value of 1 or using other weird value there occurs a bug where no light hits any textures unless its directional shadow-casting light like the flashlight. Its most likely a bug tied to a mod called ShadowBoost. Its made to keep shadows resolution from draining too many graphical power and dropping your FPS. Its basically dynamic resolution and viewdistance but for shadows.


[9/15/2025 1:47 PM] therhythmz
No. Close MO2. MO2 behaves weird when another program modifies profile specific INIs while its open. Then launch Bethini as Admin with MO2 closed.


[9/15/2025 1:48 PM] therhythmz
Bethini Pie is located in a folder called Tools that can be found inside the main MO2 folder.

please create a support ticket so we can look into it. If you can grab a screenshot of the backpack dropped out of your inventory and selected while inside the console that'd be a great help


[9/15/2025 5:53 PM] ursorenda

Hello everyone. I installed FO4 completely new in English. The game is up to date. Then I started the game once, as usual. Wabbajack downloads everything, but when it comes to installation, it says: Missing File - Data_Fallout4 - Voices.ba2!
But why?


[9/15/2025 8:59 PM] ursorenda
You can ignore it as far as main story quests allow (sanctuary quests require building)


[9/15/2025 9:00 PM] raider216

[9/15/2025 9:01 PM] ursorenda
Read the install guide and remember that I wasn’t lying when I said sometimes that just happens.

You can try again at a later time and it should work, I *can not tell you how long to wait*

Some people wait a day and it works, some people wait a week and it works, some people wait 5 minutes and it works. It’s a wabbajack bug.


[9/15/2025 9:01 PM] raider216
My bullets send you to heaven.


[9/15/2025 9:01 PM] ursorenda
They should


[9/15/2025 9:02 PM] ursorenda
That’s either an initialization bug or an installation corruption. Starting a new game to test will tell you which (if it matters to you, I guess :p)


[9/15/2025 9:04 PM] raider216
I know this ain’t the help desk, but do I set my Page File back to default if I ain’t playing Anomaly?

Don’t want my puter fried lmao.

Page File is something foreign to me.


[9/15/2025 9:05 PM] ursorenda
You don’t have to


[9/15/2025 9:06 PM] ursorenda
It’s literally just a mechanism for RAM to bleed usage onto your hard drive, as opposed to chugging and potentially crashing your pc/the program you’re using


[9/15/2025 9:07 PM] ursorenda
Fine to leave it for the remainder of your compooters life, also fine to remove it (though anomally will absolutely chug on you unless your pc is beastly)


[9/15/2025 9:09 PM] raider216
Gotcha, was just worried ‘cause I heard this and thus.

[9/15/2025 9:33 PM] ursorenda
It’s called PA training IIRC


[9/15/2025 9:33 PM] ursorenda
Also pretty sure it’s a master for some of the patches, but you’re welcome to try disabling it


[9/15/2025 9:34 PM] dagobertdogburglar
Where can you get it besides BoS? Atom cats? Was gonna do an america rising 2 run but i may disable it bc idk if it has support for that lol


[9/15/2025 9:34 PM] ursorenda
It does not have support for AR2, but yeah atom cats and there’s a trainer at bunker hill. Also one for minute men if you invest in their questline far enough

any way I can turn depth of field off for the mod?


[9/15/2025 11:32 PM] therhythmz
You should be able to do it from Bethini and the ENB menu. The ENB menu is accessed in-game using the Home key. In spanish its the Inicio or Fin key depending on the keyboard. Dont touch any settings you're not familiar with.


[9/15/2025 11:33 PM] therhythmz
Anyway i suggest trying Bethini first.


[9/16/2025 1:31 AM] dirtymuddman
Thanks! I have to do it every time I play, but it works!


[9/16/2025 1:31 AM] dirtymuddman
Also does anyone know how I can change the keybind for placing structures from "Enter" to "E" or even "Space Bar"?


[9/16/2025 2:31 AM] therhythmz

[9/16/2025 3:26 AM] dirtymuddman
Yeah I figured it out, I'm dealing with motion blur now and I don't know where the setting is for that.


[9/16/2025 8:08 AM] lateralus9290
Can someone tell me if companions other than Heather, require more than 1 bullet to fire a gun (when not using the default one). I noticed that Piper sometimes fires a lot even with 5-6 bullets, but then at random she 'runs out' and is back to her pistol.

Also, how exactly does the flashlight attachments work? When a companion have them it's like one of those crazy high power flashlights you can see clips online, but when I have it equipped, it's not doing anything. Is there a separate button for that that I'm missing?


[9/16/2025 9:01 AM] tiburse
I forget what mod does it but one of the flashlight mods has a "use attachment" option it is off by default. But you can turn it on.

Roads were not scrappable...right? Or is there a key to do this?


[9/16/2025 12:02 PM] nomad5157
did you enable place everywhere


[9/16/2025 12:02 PM] jonhyboy47
yes


[9/16/2025 12:04 PM] jonhyboy47
I didnt know Place Everywhere could do this...


[9/16/2025 12:05 PM] jonhyboy47
Is it safe to just delete roads like this?


[9/16/2025 12:06 PM] nomad5157
More than likely the rebuild aio mode...you could just press ESC and not scrap the road


[9/16/2025 12:06 PM] therhythmz
I would disable that one if i were you. If you scrap the wrong thing without realizing it you will break previs.


[9/16/2025 12:07 PM] jonhyboy47
Yeah thats what I was afraid of...breaking Previs...So can I just disable midgame or start fresh?


[9/16/2025 12:08 PM] nomad5157
You will be fine. Settelemts are lacking in 0.5 but will have a complete new overhaul in .6


[9/16/2025 12:11 PM] jonhyboy47
I want to believe that. But m not sure how to proceed here...safest way to play is with or without Place Anywhere?


[9/16/2025 12:11 PM] nomad5157
Disable it


[9/16/2025 12:12 PM] jonhyboy47
Alright Thanks


[9/16/2025 12:12 PM] nomad5157
That's why it's optional. YMMV


[9/16/2025 12:14 PM] nomad5157
Like I said earlier the scrapping of the road if I recall is rebuild aio mod....just don't scrap them

Yeah and I'm saying, I'm perfectly happy to accept the issues bud, otherwise I'll have to use a different list that supports 144hz


[9/16/2025 2:38 PM] jonhyboy47
Sorry about that! Wont happen again...


[9/16/2025 2:38 PM] ursorenda
No worries m8


[9/16/2025 2:39 PM] ursorenda
Then you might need to use a different list that supports 144hz. I’m not sure any exist but if they’re out there then more power to you, bud


[9/16/2025 2:40 PM] ursorenda
(You could also just adjust your monitors refresh rate to 120hz)

promise you can’t tell the difference

[9/16/2025 3:10 PM] han8671
does anyone know where to receive power armor training? My guess would be BOS


[9/16/2025 3:11 PM] tiburse
By default is insert to enable/disable extra object selection with place anywhere. If you scrap it before rebuilding the roads when you rebuild the roads, a new object will be placed there. If you did it after your only option is to load your last save.


[9/16/2025 3:12 PM] nomad5157
They are one of the options


[9/16/2025 3:12 PM] han8671
oki thanks


[9/16/2025 3:12 PM] nomad5157
Other options out there but I wouldn't want to spoil it


[9/16/2025 3:26 PM] jonhyboy47
Good to know after all I pressed one "key" by mystake and enabled it without notice. Guess my surprise of that happening....hilarious...WTF I just do???LOOOL

[9/16/2025 3:29 PM] jonhyboy47

No problem!


[9/16/2025 4:39 PM] han8671
what do I do with the universal workbench? how do I place it? what purpose does it serve?


[9/16/2025 4:42 PM] caymiss
you make it's schematic at the utlity bench, it's placed in a settlement like the abandoned tunnels & it, like it's name implies, can be used universally to do many of the other bench actions in the one bench


[9/16/2025 4:46 PM] han8671
okay, I clicked on it to place it and i didn't work, is it because I cant place it in sanctuary?


[9/16/2025 4:52 PM] caymiss
i've only ever placed it in the Abandoned Tunnels, but placements in general follow some rules & can be tricky sometimes


[9/16/2025 4:52 PM] caymiss
check for other surfaces it may be able to work on


[9/16/2025 4:52 PM] dirtymuddman
5 hrs in and I can't even leave sanctuary without dying to 20 different types of diseases :/


[9/16/2025 4:53 PM] caymiss
more than likely your RADs/IRA. if either are untreated, you'll slowly deteriorate


[9/16/2025 4:53 PM] dirtymuddman
I used all the chems I could but it's hard to keep rads down when I get rads for just being alive???


[9/16/2025 4:54 PM] dirtymuddman
smoked all my cigs and injected myself with as much as I can. I also avoid mele fights


[9/16/2025 4:54 PM] caymiss
what chems you use?


[9/16/2025 4:54 PM] dirtymuddman
the ones that reduce rads/IRA


[9/16/2025 4:54 PM] dirtymuddman
tooks about 4-6 of them


[9/16/2025 4:54 PM] dirtymuddman
went down and just rised back up in 10 mins


[9/16/2025 4:54 PM] dirtymuddman
constantly getting 1 rad no matter what.


[9/16/2025 4:55 PM] caymiss
the air is toxic and needs to be filtered out with gas masks, as a general rule


[9/16/2025 4:55 PM] caymiss
if you're getting <1 rad or >1 rad every couple of seconds, that's probably rad poisoning


[9/16/2025 4:55 PM] dirtymuddman
Which is why I've been wearing one since I left the vault.....


[9/16/2025 4:55 PM] caymiss
gas masks can break too. have you used your Rad Boy?


[9/16/2025 4:56 PM] caymiss
Ca-DTPA reduces Rads & IRA but won't cure the assosciated illnesses


[9/16/2025 4:56 PM] dirtymuddman
idk what you mean by gas mask can break? it doesn't show a durability or anything like that.


[9/16/2025 4:56 PM] caymiss
you'll need Cleaning Tonic to cure Radiation Poisoning


[9/16/2025 4:56 PM] dirtymuddman
Ya I took all the CA I could and now limping to diamond city for a doctor.


[9/16/2025 4:57 PM] caymiss
refer to this chart for RAD/IRA illnesses https://discord.com/channels/1113971680419782666/1236716935228424305/1412210782195941547

I just don't understand how I'm getting sick when I use gas mask and anti radiation armor but still getting disease left and right just for breathing. wearing a gas mask and everything does nothing. It's kinda as if I'm just stuck dying constantly due to 20 illnessess I have


[9/16/2025 4:58 PM] caymiss
it's a mechanic in Anomaly, happens to me rarely though


[9/16/2025 4:58 PM] dirtymuddman
Yeah but how?


[9/16/2025 4:58 PM] dirtymuddman
makes no sense

getting shot in the face


[9/16/2025 4:58 PM] nomad5157
Theres a guide there


[9/16/2025 4:58 PM] dirtymuddman
I took all the procautions as possible.


[9/16/2025 4:58 PM] dirtymuddman
cool, not related to the converstation but nice lol.


[9/16/2025 4:59 PM] caymiss
no, it is related, the guide related to the illnesses you're afflicted to


[9/16/2025 4:59 PM] caymiss
are directly talked about in the guide


[9/16/2025 4:59 PM] dirtymuddman
the installation guide?


[9/16/2025 4:59 PM] caymiss
scroll down


[9/16/2025 4:59 PM] nomad5157
did you look at the image?


[9/16/2025 5:00 PM] caymiss
i felt like you when i first began, when you get a general grip of the mechanics it becomes much much easier and more manageable


[9/16/2025 5:01 PM] caymiss
so don't worry. the 4 things i carry with me at all times are; Ca-DTPA, Cleansing Tonic, Potassium Iodide and Antibiotics


[9/16/2025 5:01 PM] caymiss
those 4 things will deal with any radiation/ira problem in the game period


[9/16/2025 5:01 PM] ursorenda
We need to creative some kind of incentive for server members who exemplify that they actually read the resources we provide 🙃


[9/16/2025 5:01 PM] dirtymuddman
Stalker gamma feels a lot more chill then this is all I'm saying. 
That guide doesn't help me at all. How do you leave santuary with 8 different radiation poisions and no way to be healed???

This material here does not help you?


[9/16/2025 5:02 PM] dirtymuddman
not at all just tells me i'm fucked


[9/16/2025 5:02 PM] caymiss
xd


[9/16/2025 5:02 PM] nomad5157
Can you take the few minutes to read it


[9/16/2025 5:02 PM] ursorenda
If you have any form of rad poisonings leaving the vault you aren’t grasping the lethality of radiation


[9/16/2025 5:02 PM] dirtymuddman
like where's the closest doctor if you get infected before even leaving the actual starting area


[9/16/2025 5:03 PM] dirtymuddman
is there a way to teleport out of the vault then? they kinda make you go through iraddiated water.


[9/16/2025 5:03 PM] nomad5157
You get rads > you don't cure rads > You get IRA > You get diseases


[9/16/2025 5:03 PM] caymiss
if you're breathing in poisonous air and playing in irradiated water, you're bound to get sick m8


[9/16/2025 5:04 PM] ursorenda
Yeah and when you hear the geiger counter you should be sprinting through/from it


[9/16/2025 5:04 PM] nomad5157
No, it's good feedback that area is a bit of a pain


[9/16/2025 5:04 PM] nomad5157
I will adjust that area to avoid it


[9/16/2025 5:04 PM] nomad5157
but you need to take the time and read through the gameplay guide in the meantime


[9/16/2025 5:05 PM] dirtymuddman
Stalker gamma is just way more simplier then this is all I'm saying


[9/16/2025 5:05 PM] dirtymuddman
and I expected a hardcore game like that not a impossible one lol


[9/16/2025 5:05 PM] caymiss
the game's pretty easy ngl bro


[9/16/2025 5:05 PM] ursorenda
Remember that we made things to be punishingly realistic. 

Also remember that very few people have such an “insurmountable” issue with radiation


[9/16/2025 5:05 PM] dirtymuddman
Nice want to just go into my brain then buddy?

[9/16/2025 5:09 PM] ursorenda
It’s not really a “choose how you wanna play” modpack. It’s a “learn what works and what doesn’t” mod pack.


We get comments like yours once every week or so and honestly? Reading between the lines it seems to be more an issue of failing to navigate the core threats appropriately. 

If you want something chill, go play Gamma, or Wasteland Reborn, or pick a modpack. 

We appreciate feedback, as Nomad has already exemplified we’re willing to accept criticism.

Just don’t be like the majority of dissenters and turn general chat into your own personal venting grounds. Put your thoughts together and use the https://discord.com/channels/1113971680419782666/1364208073060651048, i *promise you* the devs read them and apply changes as the community communicates they’re needed


[9/16/2025 5:12 PM] nomad5157
Also, just to clarify, we are not Gamma, and we’re not trying to be Gamma in any way. These are two completely different games with very different systems, so don’t let the similarity in names confuse you.


[9/16/2025 5:13 PM] nomad5157
Thx for your help ❤️


[9/16/2025 5:14 PM] caymiss
ye np. the mechanics seem daunting at first, but when you understand it - it becomes much simpler


[9/16/2025 5:14 PM] dirtymuddman
I haven't yet I only spoken my mind about the starting location and no access to medical means starting out. 
I still like the concept and crap, but I'm probably gonna have to restart again is all I'm saying. I'm not talking crap to anyone and infact have made light humor jokes about it.
Anyway hopefully my second go around goes better. the mechanics are a bit to learn for sure.


[9/16/2025 5:15 PM] nomad5157
feel free to share feedback in the #📥player-feedback channel. That area you're in is new and still needs some changes to it


[9/16/2025 5:15 PM] nomad5157
Please look over the gameplay guide when you run into something...usually will find what you need in there.


[9/16/2025 5:16 PM] dirtymuddman
I discovered the sewer system at sanctuary and was just hoping to make it to diamond city to a doctor, but sadly I kept croaking at the bridge with the boat.


[9/16/2025 5:16 PM] nomad5157
the diner outside concord there is a doctor


[9/16/2025 5:16 PM] nomad5157
you can also craft most of this stuff


[9/16/2025 5:17 PM] dirtymuddman
Yeah it's been helpful so far. I just read the guide to install it, but I'm still needing to learn what I need to do to take steps in prolonging my death lol.


[9/16/2025 5:17 PM] dirtymuddman
Oh? I did make it there at least.


[9/16/2025 5:17 PM] dirtymuddman
Maybe my progress can still be saved lol.


[9/16/2025 5:18 PM] caymiss
if you want to, use \ ingame and search for the relevant items to cure your diseases to save your progress (though it is cheating)


[9/16/2025 5:18 PM] caymiss
there's also a cheat terminal in your MISC that can heal you ig


[9/16/2025 5:19 PM] caymiss
just until you understand the mechanics and not be too frustrated in the meantime


[9/16/2025 5:27 PM] nomad5157
There are a lot of ways we could make it harder :p but that wouldn’t be fun


[9/16/2025 5:27 PM] nomad5157
Maybe 0.6 we will make a prepare to die mode

was running into the same issue early game off painfully stacking debuffs with no nearby doctor and no perks or medicine early game to deal with it appropriately


[9/16/2025 5:47 PM] dagobertdogburglar
honestly the rest is whatever but the Lithium Lung debuff is incredibly strong


[9/16/2025 5:47 PM] dagobertdogburglar
no sprint kills you


[9/16/2025 5:50 PM] nomad5157
Have you got ahold of the cleansing tonic yet and understand the mechanics now?


[9/16/2025 5:56 PM] raider216
This is why I highly value stealth in a modlist like this.

No need to sprint, if they don’t know you’re there in the first place.


[9/16/2025 5:57 PM] raider216
Probably gonna be my first build is the intelligent stealthy commando.


[9/16/2025 5:59 PM] dirtymuddman
I 100% feel the pain. I have Brittle Bones, Cesium Cold, Lithium Lung, Nuclear Diarrhea, Periodic Light Rads, Uranium Fever, and Weak Muscles. 🤣


[9/16/2025 5:59 PM] raider216
You are filled with 100% cancer and aids.


[9/16/2025 5:59 PM] dirtymuddman
Indeed and about to have a stroke lol.


[9/16/2025 6:00 PM] raider216
How the hell did you accumulate such diseases? You’d be a dead man in reality if you had that many IRL lmao.


[9/16/2025 6:01 PM] raider216
Actually don’t answer that, I want surprises.


[9/16/2025 6:01 PM] dirtymuddman
I don't even know honestly and I think that was my downfall lol.


[9/16/2025 6:01 PM] dirtymuddman
I was just trying to cure them, but kept getting more.


[9/16/2025 6:02 PM] raider216
Interesting, did you intake too much IRA?


[9/16/2025 6:02 PM] dirtymuddman
pretty sure it was probably a zombie or something that started the train.


[9/16/2025 6:02 PM] dirtymuddman
Ah and that lol.


[9/16/2025 6:02 PM] dirtymuddman
I didn't realize IRA would do that at first.


[9/16/2025 6:02 PM] raider216
Oh shit, zombies actually do bad shit to ya in this?


[9/16/2025 6:03 PM] raider216
I hate ferals, they always get the jump on me.


[9/16/2025 6:03 PM] dirtymuddman
anything that's mele can I believe. I'm also not strong up close as well.


[9/16/2025 6:03 PM] nomad5157
zombies will fuck you up


[9/16/2025 6:03 PM] raider216
Honestly in this modlist, I wouldn’t be strong in the melee department either.

I’d be focusing on stealth and range.


[9/16/2025 6:03 PM] nomad5157
2 bars of IRA is a bad day for you anything more is deadly


[9/16/2025 6:04 PM] dirtymuddman
My left side of my screen was basically 75% a green bar lol.


[9/16/2025 6:04 PM] raider216
Damn, and I thought Capital Commonwealth would be hard.

Capital commonwealth seems pretty cool btw


[9/16/2025 6:12 PM] raider216
I tried it, didn’t get very far ‘cause I didn’t know about Page File or Steam Overlay causing BS.

But honestly? I wanted to make FO4 something entirely different, something foreign, unfamiliar, and challenging.

I am still seeing that mod after a fresh install. Deleted everything except download folder. Was 0.5.7.3 the correct version?


[9/16/2025 7:58 PM] ursorenda
The splash shows 0.5.7.4, that image is incorrect


[9/16/2025 7:58 PM] ursorenda
If you downloaded from wabba you’re on 0.5.7.4


[9/16/2025 7:58 PM] levithian95
Gotcha. Yeah not really sure why Remnants bunker keeps being installed


[9/16/2025 7:59 PM] nomad5157
I see the issue...will fix it here shortly hm. Thank you for pointing it out

[9/16/2025 10:34 PM] nomad5157
Good or bad? I only made like 20 presets


[9/16/2025 10:35 PM] raider216
There’s 20? I was putting “recon” or “commando” and kept getting Balanced Survivor.

It was only until sniper that I got the sniper specialist.


[9/16/2025 10:35 PM] nomad5157
Yeah it's only tied to certain keywords


[9/16/2025 10:36 PM] raider216
Figured, only I don’t know what those words are other than “sniper” “brute” and all the examples.

Do the Brotherhood have modern uniforms? Was curious from one image on whether that was normal in the modlist or an addition (or if it was even anomaly).


[9/16/2025 10:39 PM] nomad5157
its a mix but mostly yes


[9/16/2025 10:39 PM] raider216

not full out call of duty uniforms like you're probably use to its a lore "friendly" modern setup

[9/17/2025 2:19 AM] therhythmz
Dismemberment is buggy when enabled alongside MAIM. Severed limbs remain "linked" to their owners. If you shoot a severed hand on the floor, it does damage to its original owner. You can try to enable it using a "post death animation" kind of mod like those that enhance gore. But dismembering while alive creates bugs.

Thanks. doing better on my 2nd run so far. Also is there a way to keep my saves when I sleep. I don't mind sleeping being the main way I have to save, but would be awesome to keep the saves I make when I sleep.


[9/17/2025 4:11 AM] jiszle
What's the current mod for sleeping on the go? Like camping or a sleeping bag


[9/17/2025 4:11 AM] jiszle
i see you cant really just lay down anywhere anymore with L haha


[9/17/2025 4:26 AM] caymiss
cigarettes are the main way to save outside of the Survival Pack. 
@jiszle sleeping bags can be made/purchased for sleeping on the go. although, they only let you sleep for 3 or 5 hours iirc so not optimal. there's also a way to camp, i saw a perk for it but never got into it myself. would probably be in survival perks.

[9/17/2025 4:27 AM] caymiss
also cigarettes do auto-saves while the Survival Pack are hard saves, auto-saves are only the most recent 3 while hard saves are forever.

I had two slight issues last night after getting everything running and as such I have a couple questions.. is VATS disabled? I wasn't able to get it trigger at all.

Second, is it normal for MCM to freeze up my game? I tried waiting a few minutes but it never came back to and I had to force close


[9/17/2025 9:27 AM] quizzy317
I installed it on my Deck. It's doable but doesn't run very well. Not the modlist's fault, the Deck just isn't strong enough. There was also constant crashing when going through loading screens. I ended up just building a PC and using Apollo/Moonlight to stream it to my Deck lol


[9/17/2025 9:32 AM] friendy._
Thanks for the reply, yeah I must say I use Apollo/Moonlight for other modlist it would just be nice If I didn't have to rely on the main rig lmao

[9/17/2025 9:48 AM] mkdevst8r
These two issues are somewhat related.. I think it got replaced yes? So I tried to check the MCM keybinds causing the freeze up

Replying to an old message here, but trying to find out where to begin with settlement trade routes. Assuming they've been changed, but after retaking the castle, can't seem to figure out next step


[9/18/2025 2:51 AM] caymiss
in base Anomaly, the hotkey switch does exist for all vision modes. in order to craft it, you need to find the schematics for West Tek in the Med Tek Research lobby under the desk that you see as soon as you enter.


[9/18/2025 2:52 AM] caymiss
when you get the schematics, the West Tek optics can be modified at the armor bench and the hotkey can be crafted at the armorsmith under one of the "Utility" tabs


[9/18/2025 2:53 AM] caymiss
you can then add it to one of your hotkeys (1-9 etc) and use it accordingly, it'll also exist in your H-bar


[9/18/2025 2:54 AM] ursorenda
It’s not something you would be able to enable without dramatically changing how damage is calculated.

[9/18/2025 3:06 AM] raider216
Sorry to ask this here, just one final question before I finally start.

I'm trying to set up Page File but confused, I have 32 GB of RAM so do I set maximum size to 45000?


[9/18/2025 3:06 AM] raider216
I got 4884 as minimum size that is recommended.


[9/18/2025 3:07 AM] yami_ger
Honestly to that no clue i never set one up for the list snd it runs fine for me


[9/18/2025 3:07 AM] raider216
Been noticing crashes on another modlist and I think Overlay and Page File might've been screwing me over.

So I figured even though I got a decent PC, I might as well take another performance advantage.


[9/18/2025 3:12 AM] raider216
I think setting maximum to 45000 is a safe bet, if anything it just won’t get that high.


[9/18/2025 3:12 AM] caymiss
my page file's set to 40gb, specifically 40960. and i have 32gb RAM


[9/18/2025 3:12 AM] raider216
Might do that too, I’ll see.


[9/18/2025 3:13 AM] caymiss
pretty sure that's the correct number for 32gb RAM because it was recommended in a Skyrim modlist


[9/18/2025 3:14 AM] caymiss
also make sure you're doing that page file setting on the drive the game is in


[9/18/2025 3:14 AM] raider216
Luckily or unluckily, I just got one SSD drive.


[9/18/2025 3:14 AM] raider216
Might get more in the future when I make more money.


[9/18/2025 3:15 AM] raider216
Though tbh I just play games and look up stuff most of the time so I never saw a great need.


[9/18/2025 3:16 AM] caymiss
it was mandatory when modding skyrim to reduce stutters. 20-40gb with 40 usually being the sweetspot.


[9/18/2025 3:16 AM] caymiss
note it will take up space on your drive, but it is reversible if you ever take a break


[9/18/2025 3:16 AM] raider216
I know, luckily I got some modding experience so I'm covered on that.

Just didn't have experience altering the PC itself.


[9/18/2025 3:17 AM] raider216
Other than occasional upgrades.


[9/18/2025 3:22 AM] caymiss
as far as overlays are concerned, they can cause issues. i turned off all except steam; nvidia, discord etc.


[9/18/2025 3:24 AM] ursorenda
Overlay will affect almost any game, this modpack it’ll affect it a lot


[9/18/2025 3:24 AM] raider216
I disabled Steam Overlay cause I hardly use it beyond screenshots.

I think of ‘em as unnecessary bloat imo, I’m a solitary gamer.


[9/18/2025 3:24 AM] ursorenda
Pagefile just helps prevent memory overload crashes


[9/18/2025 3:25 AM] raider216
Well, won’t be a bother to have on anyways then lmao.


[9/18/2025 3:27 AM] ursorenda
Mhm. Will also help performance outside of the mod pack, though not many programs use that much ram 😂


[9/18/2025 3:28 AM] raider216
Tomorrow I’ll see just how effective it is, this actually reminded me to disable Nvidia and Discord overlays.

But that only *really* helps amd cpu users. Does help intel users a tiny bit

What’s core isolation?

Another windows “feature” that was “designed for gaming” but ultimately just makes things worse

Directions for turning off memory integrity and the Virtual Machine Platform to improve gaming performance, and the risks of doing so.


[9/18/2025 3:33 AM] raider216
Of course they did, experts at making software just not for gaming lmao.


[9/18/2025 3:34 AM] ursorenda
I think their engineers are probably really intelligent, it’s the mid level and upper level managers getting barked at about P&Ls that’s the issue lol


[9/18/2025 3:35 AM] raider216
Oh I never doubted their intelligence.

Just a bit ironic, systems designed for games but make ‘em worse.


[9/18/2025 3:39 AM] raider216
Any risks involved?


[9/18/2025 3:39 AM] raider216
I know they bandy about “security” but I like outside perspective.


[9/18/2025 3:39 AM] raider216
I mean as long as I don’t download “Hot Beauty Booty” I think I’d be fine.


[9/18/2025 3:44 AM] tiburse
All it does is make the "core" of windows run in a virtual machine to keep programs from interacting with it. That being said it wont help if you the user download "Hot Beauty Booty" and approve the popup to run it. All at the minor cost of 10-15% of your cpu performance and about 20% of your ram.


[9/18/2025 3:46 AM] tiburse
The eventual goal of core isolation in gaming is to prevent code injection into games thus making cheats harder to use/deveop.


[9/18/2025 3:47 AM] raider216
Gotcha.

Anyone knows a quick fix for the resolution bug? i changed settings to my native resolution (2560x1440) and it goes into fullscreen but the game itself is in the top left corner


[9/18/2025 9:16 AM] tiburse
yep, gotta set the dpi on the FO4 exe under property's > compatibility to application controlled


[9/18/2025 9:20 AM] chadwarden69420
not gonna lie, no idea what that dpi means, any chance of explaining it to me?


[9/18/2025 9:22 AM] tiburse
DPI Scaling can affect how applications are displayed and can cause elements contained within them to fall out of alignment (example: fonts), or entire sections of applications to disappear. This is because text and other elements enlarge to scale with window size, but the containers that hold the text and other elements do not resize.

[9/18/2025 9:23 AM] tiburse
TLDR game was made before widescreen monitors were fully mainstream and so it launches in a weird 4:3 low resolution mode.

[9/18/2025 9:23 AM] tiburse
By setting it to application controlled you allow the resolution you set in the INI to take priority.

[9/18/2025 9:36 AM] chadwarden69420
CORRECTION: It actually did work after 4 pc resets, no idea how or why but it just made itself work, thanks for the help


[9/18/2025 9:36 AM] tiburse
Now that one is really odd, do you have any overlays installed? Overwolf, nvidia, steam, ect?


[9/18/2025 9:37 AM] tiburse
If you do they are known to cause issues and we highly reccomend turning them off.

Hello! Just wondering if there is an xbox controller preset that works. I am having trouble with just using the modern FPS controller mod in MO2


[9/18/2025 9:39 AM] tiburse
That would be one for the devs. Outside of my wheelhouse as I dont use controllers unless its my hotas or wheel for other games. Please do not ping devs. Once they are awake and functional they normally check chat and respond where needed.


[9/18/2025 9:40 AM] picoday
Oh okay! Yeah, I never really was going to ping them at all. Only you. Just now.


[9/18/2025 9:41 AM] tiburse

On a similar note, is there any way to have the Windows scaling option in the settings apply to specific apps/games? I ask because I currently have my PC hooked up to my 77 inch LG C1 and the scaling is set to 300% to make it usable lol but having to go into settings and change scaling to 100% to get Anomaly to play properly is mildly inconvenient. Any solutions?

Is there a way to save with a keybind? I love this mod but the saving system feels too punishing to me and I cant get to enjoy it. Would like it that it is an optional feature


[9/18/2025 5:34 PM] raider216
Makes it more punishing, punishment leads to improvement, so grind hard little bro.

Also I don’t think so, could be wrong.


[9/18/2025 5:35 PM] vextin
Not a supported method, no


[9/18/2025 5:36 PM] vextin
It's more punishing, yes, but *also* it forces you to make safer saves and helps prevent save bloat & corruption

hey, to be honest i didnt really try to find a solution, seems to be related to previs, so probably disabling the previs mods temporarily, doing whatever you need to do inside the tunnel, and then re-enabling them afterwards *might* work? (haven't really tried so i can't say :P)

after the update im still running into the mass pike tunnel crash, ive edited the list tho so im guessing this falls out of the realm of support


[9/19/2025 5:21 PM] porkchop9504
worth noting only time ive experienced a crash with this list in this 40 hr run, really smooth experience


[9/19/2025 5:50 PM] quizzy317
There is a bug with the vault-tec office mod. 

I just discovered it, started exploring and died to raiders. 

Reloaded previous save and went back and it appears no raiders are spawning anymore. The place is completely devoid of NPCs except the protectron near the elevator. I don't see anyone else having reported this here or in the mods forum or bug reports.

Quick question. When updating, the guide mentions as a good practice to remove the install folder. Which one is this exactly? The entire anomaly folder where the MO is located or the mods one? I noticed that since I didn't do that step, after updating yesterday, the plutonium bugs were still around and breaking my plates.

Hi!


[9/20/2025 7:17 AM] tiburse
Good morning.


[9/20/2025 7:17 AM] tiburse
Sorry been catching up on work stuff tonight so I can take a long weekend to work on the yard and get some playtesting in.


[9/20/2025 7:57 AM] chadwarden69420
can anyone tell me how exactly am i supposed to craft guns from scratch? it says at any weapon workbench but i cant find a way to do so at a workbench


[9/20/2025 7:58 AM] chadwarden69420
also, is there a way to disable music? it doesnt appear in the settings > audio


[9/20/2025 8:06 AM] tiburse
that would be a weaponsmith bench

[9/20/2025 8:07 AM] chadwarden69420
any way i can craft it? or should i search for it somewhere in the wastes?


[9/20/2025 8:07 AM] tiburse
you would craft it in settlement under the crafting tab


[9/20/2025 8:09 AM] chadwarden69420
hm, as i checked for the benches the only one i could craft was the manufacturing bench iirc


[9/20/2025 8:09 AM] chadwarden69420
at least it was the only one showing up in the crafting tab


[9/20/2025 8:12 AM] tiburse

also, i got my hands on a brand new assault gas mask with 800 radres and i still get periodic +1 rads and additional tissue damage, am i missing something?


[9/20/2025 8:16 AM] tiburse
Nope, you do know even modern day hazmat suits are not 100% rad proof.


[9/20/2025 8:16 AM] tiburse
All depends on the type of rads and how strong they are,


[9/20/2025 8:16 AM] tiburse
Youll still get them even with a mask.


[9/20/2025 8:16 AM] chadwarden69420
yeah, but still thought it would reduce the periodic rads, but yeah, it makes sense

[9/20/2025 9:30 AM] tiburse
Nah, I have woodys wasteland stuff, cvc dead wasteland, snappable junk fences, and workshop reforged. In that load order.


[9/20/2025 9:31 AM] tiburse
Ive tested most of the most popular workshop mods and found little issues


[9/20/2025 9:31 AM] tiburse
Sim Settlements is a bit much given how script heavy it is


[9/20/2025 9:31 AM] tiburse
so that one is a def no go


[9/20/2025 9:31 AM] cornelius2179
Alright cool thank you


[9/20/2025 9:48 AM] picoday
So, when I installed the list after the hotfix, nothing was changed or added to the pack. In game, I was able to still find those plutonium-skinned creatures, as well as the invisible bowie knife. Could there be an issue with wabbajack?


[9/20/2025 9:52 AM] jonhyboy47
I second this...same problem


[9/20/2025 9:53 AM] picoday
Ignore me. Doing the same exact same thing I did previously seemed to add/remove the mods


[9/20/2025 9:53 AM] picoday
I guess second time's the charm. Lol. Also, it didn't take nearly as long to load everything, which I think is also weird


[9/20/2025 10:01 AM] jonhyboy47
How so? Would you mind explain what you did?


[9/20/2025 10:05 AM] picoday
Well, to be honest, it's a little bit of a confusing process to apply this hotfix. The fixes are added now to the modloader, but still have no effect. That bowie knife bug is still in my save, as well as a new problem birthed just after re-installing that time just now. A workshop framework error suggesting to not play the save anymore due to a invalid configuration. Not sure what to do lol


[9/20/2025 10:06 AM] picoday
Also, it could be that I am not completely uninstalling the modlist before updating, but that shouldn't be neccessary. At least compared to other similar modpacks. That would also take all day for me to do, which isn't really too big of a problem, but just... silly?


[9/20/2025 10:18 AM] jonhyboy47
Well it could help for you to know when this happen to have this modlist saved somewhere else, apart of everything, even in other SSD available, just for those 150gb downloads. This helps next time around you have to redo things. Its higly unlikely that these zip files are not updated so should be safe to proceed. Because 350gb is always what you get as final result in this modlist (downloads + mo2 mods).


[9/20/2025 10:23 AM] jonhyboy47
But I am confused aswell. If it is updated it should work on the fly...


[9/20/2025 10:23 AM] picoday
Yeah, I am willing to bet that workshop error is actually more or less safety negligible. Only because I think it references the change/removal of that Enclave bunker mod. However, I can’t devote more gigs than what is initially advertised. I’m not going to bloat my storage for a modpack


[9/20/2025 10:24 AM] picoday
Very strange


[9/20/2025 10:28 AM] jonhyboy47
You said probably that a save could be an issue...how about we try that? New game for reassurance and check things out?


[9/20/2025 10:33 AM] jonhyboy47
Nevermind that...I already checked with new save. Still no textures on bowie knife.


[9/20/2025 10:34 AM] jonhyboy47
Gonna report this to Support channel...something is very wrong here


[9/20/2025 10:38 AM] lateralus9290
Yep, mine is missing textures as well. I deleted the entire installation folder and downloaded/installed anomaly from scratch. Then I moved the save folder back and loaded the game.


[9/20/2025 10:40 AM] jonhyboy47
That exactly how I did and same deal...must be wabbajack issue or something


[9/20/2025 10:42 AM] lateralus9290
Don't see the plutonium creatures in the modlist anymore so that is something at least


[9/20/2025 10:43 AM] jonhyboy47
On mine they are...

What if those files from hotfixes could also be seperatly available for download with instructions in announcements? This could be a possibility for those who have more experience in mo2 as less stressful way to avoid having to update from wabbajack and quicker since unpopulates wabbajack servers?

[9/20/2025 3:45 PM] nomad5157
It's not something we are going to support at this moment. Any issues with the Wabbajack install process should and most likely will be fixed. Adding in a secondary way to install updates just casues more man power to support if something doesn't work correctly


[9/20/2025 3:46 PM] nomad5157
0.5 is just getting small patches to fix bugs/add small features in while we are working on moving fully to 0.6 - which will be way more streamlined and issues you're having now should be resolved with our launcher


[9/20/2025 4:02 PM] jonhyboy47
Okay...I see what you getting at. You are absolutely right and I didnt think of that. Even so, it could work just without support atm.

[9/20/2025 4:36 PM] jonhyboy47
With mods removed in hotfix...will other saves still be compatible?


[9/20/2025 4:38 PM] tiburse
Thats a call that is above my paygrade. Once we know we willlet you know.


[9/20/2025 4:46 PM] jonhyboy47

[9/20/2025 4:59 PM] nomad5157
You are fine to play now


[9/20/2025 5:03 PM] jonhyboy47
Is that thinghy with wabbajack solved?


[9/20/2025 5:04 PM] nomad5157
No but you can play now you will be fine the issues you're having won't prevent you from playing


[9/20/2025 5:06 PM] jonhyboy47
Alright. But what about saves...If things will be removed, isnt that supose to be a problem later if updating?


[9/20/2025 5:06 PM] nomad5157
No, you will be fine. The workshop pop up is just from the bunker mod


[9/20/2025 5:07 PM] jonhyboy47
Hmm. Okay then. Thanks again for help.

Thank you for the kind words. We appreciate the candor. You are fine, just make sure if you run into an issue you file a support form. General questions and where is x setting  are fine for the most part. Just make sure to use the search function, chances are its been asked before haha.


[9/20/2025 7:01 PM] picoday
Yes! Of course! That's no problem at all. Just was in a bit of a rush, but I'll make a form from now on

It's unfortunate that weapons like the Winchester, or shotguns, if you're only missing one or two rounds when you reload, it loads everything. They'd be a lot more viable otherwise.


[9/20/2025 9:16 PM] martyr.kix
I feel you there. The reload times would be dropped massively


[9/20/2025 9:29 PM] nomad5157

is explosions going through walls a design choice or a bug


[9/20/2025 10:30 PM] nomad5157
Some think it's a bug....I made it that way because these walls are like 200 years old and explosions can go through walls IRL


[9/20/2025 10:31 PM] nomad5157
Going behind a plank wall should not save you from a frag grenade


[9/20/2025 10:31 PM] vextin
Explosions can go through walls, but it doesn't matter how old the wall is, a frag isn't going through a foot of concrete 😭


[9/20/2025 10:31 PM] vextin
wooden walls makes sense


[9/20/2025 10:32 PM] vextin
but i think without a more robust penetration check it FEELS like a bug and detracts from player buy-in


[9/20/2025 10:32 PM] nomad5157
well it's not one or the other it's either all the way or none at all without a script in place


[9/20/2025 10:33 PM] vextin
ye I understand it's not as easy as I made it sound


[9/20/2025 10:33 PM] nomad5157
I will eventually remove the flag because I know a lot see it as a bug


[9/20/2025 10:34 PM] vextin
to your credit, I can't think of a single game that does grenade penetration correctly


[9/20/2025 10:35 PM] nomad5157
maybe tarkov?


[9/20/2025 10:35 PM] vextin
ha was just about to use tarky as an example


[9/20/2025 10:35 PM] vextin

No shot! I never thought I’d see the day I was actually assuming the mod was abandoned! Hell yeah!

how do i open a support ticket?


[9/21/2025 9:44 PM] nomad5157
I've been testing it for 4 days and no issues so far but I'm sure it's bound for something to pop up


[9/21/2025 9:45 PM] kults420
its just that the UI is stuck in the top left of my screen lmao ik its not my resolution because in actual gameplay its fine its just the HUD and UI


[9/21/2025 11:32 PM] girgenti
Can't wait until I get my pc fixed T_T


[9/21/2025 11:52 PM] nomad5157
I do suggest starting a new save if you are still pretty early on in your save. A new area to explore at start of the game and a couple new surprises thrown in ;). 

I am seeing this version showing on Wabbajack now. Make sure you are downloading **0.5.7.6** @Important Notice  if you do not see it close Wabbajack and reopen a few minutes later.

for all 3 people awake or whatever, is anyones game freezing on intro cutscene after the update?


[9/22/2025 1:11 AM] charles_malgar
I just started a new save for the update and it's only letting me pick 2 skills instead of the usual 3. Is that intentional or did the mcm settings bug again?


[9/22/2025 1:12 AM] nomad5157
It's intentional I lowered them down


[9/22/2025 1:12 AM] charles_malgar
Thanks, just wanted to make sure.


[9/22/2025 1:13 AM] nomad5157
Do you mean when you launch the game?


[9/22/2025 1:13 AM] bluerockx.
when starting new game, the cutscene gets like 3 frames in then completely frozen


[9/22/2025 1:13 AM] bluerockx.
i say as it doesn't happen this time


[9/22/2025 1:14 AM] nomad5157
So after you press new game...make sure all steps in read me is done, but glad it's working now.


[9/22/2025 1:15 AM] bluerockx.
all of the read me stuff has been done for like the past 4 updates lol, its just my luck, something always seems to break for me

it might be gpu related tbh, i've always had issues with my 7900xtx drivers


[9/22/2025 1:18 AM] nomad5157
Starting a new game has always been iffy when so many mods are added in

Let me know what you think of the changes in the vault btw 🙂


[9/22/2025 1:20 AM] butcherofblaviken8
I'm doing the update but it got to 80% on the Anomaly Lod and then dropped down to 40kbs should i just cancel and restart it?


[9/22/2025 1:21 AM] nomad5157
Just wait a bit longer and see if it picks up...if not I would delete that download from the download folder and restart wabbajack...sometimes things just slow down

Doesnt happen to often with updates for me but fresh installs wabbajack does it pretty often on like the last 10 pretty annoying

it's nice having a pistol from the start again. idk if this is intended but it gave me both the service pistol and the kimber. i might have just gotten lucky with rng but 13 stims feels like a lot


[9/22/2025 1:30 AM] butcherofblaviken8
Also it finished this time keen to see the new additions especially glad that you had added the defective synths mod always appreciate more unique enemies to fight


[9/22/2025 1:32 AM] martyr.kix
I was getting annoyed at the simplest shit last night


[9/22/2025 1:32 AM] nomad5157
Only supposed to give kimber...will look into that. The 13 stims is for the people who have a hard time in the vault because they will complain because...git gud

when i picked it up it said service pistol but gave me both and equipped kimber. also how the hell is the vault too hard 😭 minus the ghoul who took like 3 mags for me

Helmets and plates are a life saver.  Especially how MAIM works


[9/22/2025 1:37 AM] bluerockx.
i've noticed that on old saves.  my favorite part is when an enemy tanks a 12g to the face


[9/22/2025 1:37 AM] bluerockx.
i'm assuming gas masks are now needed all the time?


[9/22/2025 1:38 AM] nomad5157
Anything marked with snow/rain flags will need one...so anything other than clear/foggy/ etc


[9/22/2025 1:38 AM] nomad5157
rad foggy will cause it


[9/22/2025 1:39 AM] nomad5157
We will need feedback on it so please do #📥player-feedback if you have any issues or annoyance with it


[9/22/2025 1:39 AM] martyr.kix
Different calibers will have that effect. I've noticed some 12gas can rip heads, the others might as well be peas


[9/22/2025 1:39 AM] bluerockx.
i might be slightly dumb but im standing in sanctuary and getting rads without a mask. it seems to be clear weather as well

Suggest reading through the mod to learn its features


[9/22/2025 2:38 AM] nomad5157
Before you leave the vault there is a gas mask and a filter


[9/22/2025 2:38 AM] butcherofblaviken8
Ohh shit I must've missed the filter


[9/22/2025 2:38 AM] nomad5157
Filters last for 10 minutes and a HUD is shown on top left to show. You’ll also start suffocating when you don’t have a good filter in use still


[9/22/2025 2:39 AM] butcherofblaviken8
So you need to constantly wear gas masks now?


[9/22/2025 2:39 AM] mkdevst8r
ayee u guys added the night vision patch i suggested ggs


[9/22/2025 2:40 AM] mkdevst8r
hope it works out ❤️


[9/22/2025 2:40 AM] mkdevst8r
it, at the very least, will save a utility slot


[9/22/2025 2:42 AM] mkdevst8r
it says only when in anything toigged snow/rain pretty sure


[9/22/2025 2:43 AM] nomad5157
As long as you applied the MCM (big message explaining that at the cyro start) the gas mask is only needed during bad weather…there are some weathers that behave weirdly that we are looking into. All the information for this mod is covered and explained in detail on its mod page

A guide for the mod will be made in the coming week but I will be gone most of this week so I wanted to push this update out now and get feedback on it/reported bugs

Feel free to adjust its mcm values in the survival category

do night vision goggles count as glasses for the four eyes trait?


[9/22/2025 3:00 AM] nomad5157
In theory they should

ill lyk as soon as i find a pair then!


[9/22/2025 3:02 AM] mkdevst8r
i have 0 backgriund points hmm

I dunno if you start with any Background points, I didn't get any my past two starts

i did 2 days ago when i started for the first time


[9/22/2025 3:05 AM] nomad5157
Yeah that will be fixed soon. You can use the mcm menu for you are executional to add the background points. To avoid this issue just apply the mcm after you pick up the Pinot

any ideas why i may be missing some textures/mesh? did i miss something? sanctuary roads are gone, theres some rocks that are missing (walking into nothingness and being blocked) etc

Red rocket is almost entirely missing, tons more in Concord missing 🤔


[9/22/2025 4:24 AM] yami_ger
Did you added any mods or did ya use any weird console command otherwise let the reibstaöl run over again fixes it


[9/22/2025 4:25 AM] mkdevst8r
I have not. I tried to reinstall via wabbajack and it persists


[9/22/2025 4:25 AM] yami_ger
Weird you could ibstall an older version and see if hhat fixes it

okay after doing it like 5 times its finally back to normal


[9/22/2025 4:52 AM] mkdevst8r
ALRIGHT so after messing with it for about an hour i have found that Fog isolation is somehow causing this problem


[9/22/2025 4:53 AM] mkdevst8r
after my 5th reinstall i forgot to enable the optionals i was using, and went back to do so, and the issue occured again, disabled them 1 by 1 and thats definitely the problem

I've been here less than a month and I've seen so much change already. It's a remarkably stable list.


[9/22/2025 9:01 AM] bluerockx.
I found this list about a year and a half ago and there has been so many major changes in just the past 6 months or so. I don't think i've ever found any major stability problems other than one caused by gpu drivers and my oc


[9/22/2025 9:18 AM] tiburse
I’ve had two 50-hour saves and one 20-hour save since I joined the pack back in July. I couldn’t agree more. I did cause it to break a few times with a specific series of events, but those have been resolved now, haha


[9/22/2025 9:36 AM] bluerockx.
I started a new game and it didn't do it this time so maybe there was just something up with that one

I read the announcement, just wasn't sure if more masks were give big boy rad protection, the base game ones are nice, but I like looking cool

any way to spawn some filters to not instantly die hahaha


[9/22/2025 11:57 AM] tiburse
Should be able to open the mod explorer with \ then press r to open the search and type filter. Idk if they will show as I'm not home to check atm


[9/22/2025 11:58 AM] tiburse
In lack of that you could open console and type fw 15e


[9/22/2025 11:58 AM] tiburse
That will set weather to clear and could buy you enough time to craft them.

More GORE !!! NEW 1.1 Much more blood

[9/22/2025 3:10 PM] vextin
I guess I didn't even realize the gore was so lessened by maim, but thinking about it, it definitely is


[9/22/2025 3:11 PM] ursorenda
It’s not, it’s lessened by true damage and the way it calculates damage, maim just doubles that effect


[9/22/2025 3:11 PM] ursorenda
If you hit someone with enough damage gore is definitely still there, but we’re talkin mini nukes and rockets


[9/22/2025 3:12 PM] dagobertdogburglar
heard - i hadn’t seen much and coming from vanilla where people just kind of explode it was pretty abrupt lol

[9/22/2025 5:05 PM] quizzling
Check your audio in settings


[9/22/2025 5:08 PM] quizzling
Personally, I feel like the gasmasks are cool, but... it does add a bit of bloat to the inventory cause you need to keep track of the filters, and not every gasmask has access to the filters so you sorta need to trial and error to find out what works, then you got items to wipe your mask, and switch your filter, which would be better to be a hotkey or automatic


[9/22/2025 5:14 PM] nomad5157
It will be more streamlined in the coming weeks


[9/22/2025 5:15 PM] nomad5157

Hello there


[9/22/2025 6:35 PM] toxic_sound27
Idk if this is the right spot but, how do I cure sickness in this modpack? I've tried a doctor and anti-biotics and neither have seemed to do much


[9/22/2025 6:35 PM] ursorenda
game questions are fine to ask in general chat. 

which sickness in specific?


[9/22/2025 6:36 PM] toxic_sound27
Uhh stuff like Cesium Cold or Lithium Lung


[9/22/2025 6:36 PM] ursorenda
that's radiation sickness


[9/22/2025 6:37 PM] ursorenda
did you cure your radiation at the doc?


[9/22/2025 6:37 PM] toxic_sound27
Shit that makes sense


[9/22/2025 6:37 PM] toxic_sound27
Nah I didn't, I don't have enough caps


[9/22/2025 6:38 PM] ursorenda
you need to get your hands on Ca-DTPA to reduce both your RADs and your IRAs


[9/22/2025 6:38 PM] martyr.kix
For future reference you can also craft cleansing tonics


[9/22/2025 6:38 PM] ursorenda
check the bottom left of your screen, thems your RADs (the green bar)


[9/22/2025 6:39 PM] ursorenda
check your IRAs with the Radboy item in your AID category


[9/22/2025 6:39 PM] ursorenda
once those are down, like Martyr said a cleansing tonic will cure your radiation poisoning


[9/22/2025 6:39 PM] toxic_sound27
Gotcha gotcha, thanks for the help!

the price is dynamic to  the severity of your condition, so it should cost less

I have 2 quick questions for the mod:

1 i have 64 gigs of ram, do i need the page file?
2 the AMD optional files are for an AMD graphic card or an AMD processor?


[9/22/2025 9:09 PM] dagobertdogburglar
Does anyone know what to do about this 🥀


[9/22/2025 9:41 PM] deotlc
So I was wondering the enclave faction mod that allows you to join them is that fully tied into the main quest even if  you dont join them.  Like if you start the quest and get to the point where they give you a chance to stay or leave is that just it if you leave or do you have an option to destroy them like any other faction


[9/22/2025 9:41 PM] vextin
you can destroy them with whoeevr you ally with


[9/22/2025 9:42 PM] deotlc
Ok cool just making sure that Im not gonna miss out on anything if I decide to not fully join them


[9/22/2025 9:52 PM] dagobertdogburglar
if you want them to exist but not be part of them all you gotta do is unfreeze em and then dont agree to help


[9/22/2025 9:52 PM] dagobertdogburglar
theyll spawn into the world when the bos does


[9/22/2025 9:53 PM] dagobertdogburglar
and yeah i believe you have to go destroy them iirc


[9/22/2025 10:24 PM] quizzling
What happens if you just kill them in the cryo


[9/22/2025 10:27 PM] dagobertdogburglar
Unless it’s changed in a year and some, you just won’t have enclave in the save as a faction.


[9/22/2025 10:27 PM] dagobertdogburglar
the CC content and everything else enclave will be there but AR2 content will not spawn in your world like it would if you killed kellogg and didn’t kill the four in cryo

[9/23/2025 7:17 AM] ursorenda
it sounds like you might have gotten the update overwrite bug. Please make a support ticket and dig out the log from the install (wabbajack's install directory > [version used (would be 4.04.1 most likely)] > logs

Just grab the one with the highest number and include it in your support ticket please


[9/23/2025 7:19 AM] ursorenda
for most people you would want at least 40gb page file, it depends entirely on how ball bustingly overclocked your ram is 😛

The answer is yes to the first question and AMD GPU to the second.


[9/23/2025 7:20 AM] extrator
Oh thanks, i have another question tho, i downloaded the files but i don't have any mod loader, only zip files, what should i do?


[9/23/2025 7:20 AM] ursorenda
you mean to say you installed through wabbajack and it only produced zip files?


[9/23/2025 7:20 AM] extrator
Exactly


[9/23/2025 7:21 AM] extrator
I have 974 zip files


[9/23/2025 7:24 AM] ursorenda
uh.... I mean no offense when i say that's highly unlikely, and I think you might be looking at the downloads folder. 

Verify the location you specified wabbajack to install is where you are looking. 

If it is, please make a support ticket here https://discord.com/channels/1113971680419782666/1406805530504331315

please include your wabbajack log, see video for reference. @Canadian_conner you can reference this video as it's the same request.

Hit End to bring up the enb menu, uncheck depth of field (dof?) on the left. Top left save & apply. If you update the mod list through wabbajack at any point you will have to do this again

40gb page file? My old 32gb should be enough? I'm yet to have problems


[9/23/2025 7:39 AM] ursorenda
40gb is just the *most* I would set it to.


[9/23/2025 7:40 AM] ursorenda
the calculation is "technically" 1.5x your ram but nobody needs a 48gb or 96gb pagefile


[9/23/2025 7:40 AM] martyr.kix
Ahh mines set to 48 if I remember correctly


[9/23/2025 7:41 AM] ursorenda
it's all just buffer space to prevent crashes, there's technically no issue with setting it to like 500gb, though that's overkill to an almost criminal degree :p

Gotta read it all


[9/23/2025 3:33 PM] extrator
Uh...i have a quick question about the mod, the air outside is not breathable?
Like, do i always need a gas mask?


[9/23/2025 3:40 PM] tiburse
Heh you sound like me lol


[9/23/2025 3:49 PM] ursorenda
I mentioned to you the first time you asked for access that you just had to fill out the support form at the link.


[9/23/2025 3:50 PM] ursorenda
Shouldn’t be all the time, only when weather events are happening. Hit the support channel and make a ticket if it’s all the time


[9/23/2025 3:50 PM] extrator
Welp, the moment i get outside i get hit with a +12 radiations lol


[9/23/2025 3:52 PM] ursorenda
Like I said, (in the edited comment),  make a support ticket if it’s persistent even outside of weather events


[9/23/2025 3:52 PM] ursorenda
You also wanna make sure you’re applying the mcm preset


[9/23/2025 3:53 PM] ursorenda
That might be it cuz the default IIRC is “always needing a gasmask”


[9/23/2025 4:06 PM] shiro0377
i have the same issue lol

[9/23/2025 4:08 PM] tiburse
Reminds me of when my wife and I had our friend over and she was on fo4, she stepped away to go to the bathroom and I may have spawned like 3 deathclaws under that bridge for her. LOL


[9/23/2025 4:13 PM] shiro0377
lol


[9/23/2025 4:13 PM] shiro0377
idk how 2 fix the radiation problem


[9/23/2025 4:14 PM] shiro0377
maybe my character sucks


[9/23/2025 4:31 PM] charles_malgar
Are you guys wearing the gas mask while outside? I only recently got back in to the modpack, but I vaguely remember it had a metro style thing going on where the air outside is toxic pretty much all the time.


[9/23/2025 4:31 PM] shiro0377
yep


[9/23/2025 4:32 PM] charles_malgar
Did you also put in a new filter? Just asking cause I forgot it myself at first.


[9/23/2025 4:33 PM] shiro0377
i know nothing on how this mod works


[9/23/2025 4:34 PM] charles_malgar
That's fair. The gas mask works off filters that you have to replace periodically. You should have picked up a couple of fresh ones along with the mask. Check the aid section in your inventory.


[9/23/2025 4:35 PM] shiro0377
can i dm you?

[9/23/2025 4:53 PM] porkchop9504
The camera auto repositioning when im sneaking is kinda annoying is that custom camera doing that?


[9/23/2025 5:07 PM] charles_malgar
Probably unlucky. Only took me two shots to the head with the starter pistol to take it down.


[9/23/2025 5:10 PM] nomad5157
It’s hand placed.


[9/23/2025 5:12 PM] nomad5157
Probably

Any reason uneducated shooter might not be working? Have it enabled and the hotkeys assigned (q and e) and its not doing anything


[9/23/2025 5:28 PM] ursorenda
I think our devs may have inadvertantly set GMoTW to "hard mode" lol


[9/23/2025 5:29 PM] ursorenda
only thing I can think of is a bad install, make a support ticket and we can dive in to see what might be causing it

i have noticed it fine during clear weather and then also not fine during what also appears to be clear weather


[9/23/2025 5:48 PM] dagobertdogburglar
it makes me think it may be something to do with weather mods


[9/23/2025 5:48 PM] dagobertdogburglar
the base config has it set to precipitation only i noticed so idk 🚬


[9/23/2025 6:00 PM] ursorenda
could be, I'll raise it to the devs, since it seems like you aren't the only one affect. 

if you haven't already, please make a support ticket and include your save

[9/23/2025 6:04 PM] ursorenda
Close MO2 and open your tools folder in your installation directory, nav to bethini 

once there check that your paths are correct (check the drive letter as well) under edit > setup

if/once they're setup correctly, adjust display mode and resolution, then click file > save, then close


[9/23/2025 6:05 PM] quizzling
It's excellent, I do a new run every month or two, 3 is my favourite Fallout and TTW is my preferred way to play it


[9/23/2025 6:08 PM] mcflowerinc

They're working on a remaster of Frontier soon, so maybe that'll help

I got it to work, but my old pc was an actual potato so it wasn't well


[9/23/2025 6:12 PM] charles_malgar
I honestly would, except I know I have a bad habit of standing around and would burn through those filters way before I get around to having a steady supply.


[9/23/2025 6:13 PM] mcflowerinc
ill probly wait for thgat before i do ttw again


[9/23/2025 6:13 PM] martyr.kix
I also feel like It would make combat trivial.  If I remember how it works you break the mask and they suffocate


[9/23/2025 6:13 PM] lord_farquaad3911
yes


[9/23/2025 6:14 PM] extrator
Did you guys found a solution?


[9/23/2025 6:15 PM] martyr.kix
Strange


[9/23/2025 6:17 PM] charles_malgar
The filters are supposed to be in a metal chest near the vault door. If they aren't there for you, try either reloading or a fresh save altogether.

[9/23/2025 6:20 PM] dagobertdogburglar
thts just part of starting the collection


[9/23/2025 6:21 PM] dagobertdogburglar
when i say base config i am referring to the preset that anomaly comes with in mcm settings


[9/23/2025 6:47 PM] dagobertdogburglar
Anyway like i was saying though, it is set to precipitation only which makes the rads during what appears to be clear weather curious


[9/23/2025 7:38 PM] ursorenda
This part. Please make a support ticket and continue *any discussion* about it after we create a thread relative to it. 

Please don't make me ask a 5th time.


[9/23/2025 7:38 PM] ursorenda
or I guess just cease discussion about it here? general chat isn't a help desk man.


[9/23/2025 9:01 PM] ovenpringles
Roger, Thank you. For some reason I thought ENB was home button XD. I know they use it for “Realism” but it actually causes me to have a headache after awhile for some reason


[9/23/2025 9:21 PM] vextin
Yeah I hate it lol. Some pack authors change it to Home, some End, some leave it default, which is shift+enter


[9/23/2025 9:56 PM] quizzling
Anyone else get the thing were it seems weapon mods overlap? 
Like for the Handmade it lets me use the base game stuff, but also stuff that looks sorta like the AS VAL but they clip and are very jank


[9/23/2025 9:57 PM] quizzling
It also seems to happen witht he Assault Rifle, Combat Rifle, ect.


[9/23/2025 10:00 PM] emarosagt721
Hello all, hope all is well.  Having issues loading into character creator, so havent played yet. got a support ticket in the works. How similar in fallout anomaly compared to stalker gamma and anomaly? visuals, gunplay, difficulty, etc?


[9/23/2025 10:01 PM] quizzling
It has similar vibes, I wouldn't say it's as hard


[9/23/2025 10:02 PM] emarosagt721
bet! thanks for that


[9/23/2025 10:04 PM] quizzling
Take my advice with a grain of salt tbh, maybe I've just played Fallout too much, and it's been like a year or two since I've played Gamma


[9/23/2025 10:07 PM] emarosagt721
gamma is nuts in the beginning, after like 30hours is when it seems to get easy


[9/23/2025 10:09 PM] emarosagt721
i was playing anothing hard core modlist for f04 and the enemies were bullet sponges and i was made of glass, i had to "cheat" and make my armor way stronger than it should be, yet even then..


[9/23/2025 10:10 PM] emarosagt721
i also tried an NSFW modlist, im not sure i like half naked raiders lol

Yeah nothing is really a bullet sponge here, you least of all


[9/23/2025 10:18 PM] emarosagt721

Hello


[9/24/2025 3:03 PM] mkdevst8r
I'm wanting to add some building mods to the pack as I genuinely can't deal with vanilla assets it drives me insane since I like to set up each settlement a tiny bit for use as HQ's and Artillery deployment.. 

Are there any basic things I should know in regards to this? Any "Definitely don't do that" tips or general rules?

For example, I saw someone mentioning sim Settlements is script heavy and that can cause some issues.


[9/24/2025 3:05 PM] mkdevst8r
I'm not exactly a modder but I have some basic knowledge. I don't plan on adding more than a few either as I don't want to mess up the wonderful stability you all worked so hard for


[9/24/2025 3:49 PM] lateralus9290
The overhaul mods for companions were removed, right? I don't see them in the list but they are still applied in game


[9/24/2025 3:59 PM] dagobertdogburglar
I have gotten away using SS1 by not using the auto settlements anywhere in the ‘triangle of death’ (abernathy, red rocket, sanctuary) but use at your own risk


[9/24/2025 3:59 PM] dagobertdogburglar
SBS with all the living world stuff has thrown previs issues in every mod pack i tried it with


[9/24/2025 4:00 PM] dagobertdogburglar
SS2 is super script and world edit heavy so it’s a kinda non-starter unless you build around it


[9/24/2025 4:00 PM] mkdevst8r
i just threw on Homemaker and OCDecorator, that should honestly be enough. i like Sim Settlement but not enough to force it


[9/24/2025 4:01 PM] dagobertdogburglar
yeh i only really care for it in the aspect that i dont have to build everything


[9/24/2025 4:01 PM] dagobertdogburglar
but prefabs and stuff like homemaker really do ease the experience too


[9/24/2025 4:02 PM] mkdevst8r
yeah thats definitely nice but i dont plan on going too over board, i just want things to be a bit immersive, will mostly be bare bones. just enough that youd think... yeah this looks like a vanilla location

I think I see a possible cause of issue:

 Investigating reasons why it's giving "invalid form body" when trying to send to discord, I noticed the rejected forms all had 4 or more files attached. Next time you make a submission try restraining it to 3 max and see if that makes a difference

A possible workaround for now would be to get to the root cellar in sanctuary and use the mattress to save and then reload. The rads should be gone once you go back outside. That's what happened for me, anyways.


[9/24/2025 7:24 PM] deotlc
I finally did it I finished manually downloading Fallout Anomaly lol


[9/24/2025 7:25 PM] mynt_the_derg
so to Get rid of the rads, at least temporaily is the root cellar? Noted.

[9/24/2025 9:26 PM] ursorenda
no there's an issue with gasmasks of the wasteland that's causing that to happen, in the interim go into the MCM and disable the radiation features for that mod. We're working on it, just have to wait until the mod author responds

[9/25/2025 3:23 AM] lateralus9290
Anyone tried building a settlement now with the new gasmask mod? Is it even doable or is there a way to limit radiation in settlements? I've been using the tunnels my entire playthrough because it seems like it's raining 50% of the time and I was getting rads constantly.


[9/25/2025 3:26 AM] jonhyboy47
There is an air filtration system in workhop in case not aware off...It is usefull and it helps a bit to remove gasmask while building settlements


[9/25/2025 3:27 AM] jonhyboy47
its in Power - misc


[9/25/2025 3:32 AM] jonhyboy47
It creates a perimeter with filtered air...even NPCs settlers remove their masks.


[9/25/2025 3:36 AM] jonhyboy47
But since weather conditions during day, outside, have some radiation script issues...its a bit harsh to be a good solution because sometimes out of nowhere it blows some rads into your Player character (not deadly)


[9/25/2025 3:38 AM] jonhyboy47
Filtration system also can be upgraded to have bigger area covered


[9/25/2025 3:39 AM] lateralus9290
Oh, I though my game was bugged as I was getting rads even in clear weather. Which kinda made the game hard to enjoy, as most of the time I'm outdoors


[9/25/2025 3:40 AM] jonhyboy47
Its a know bug...staff team is already on it. Will be solved soon enough.

Indeed it is. But this modlist is meant to be played in survival...not other way around. Just lower your difficulty then. But why dont you try what game as to offer first? Maybe you will be suprised that is not that hard after all once getting to know basics...

[9/25/2025 9:10 AM] tiburse
I honestly do not know the exact way, other than opening the "mod" in file explorer then putting it somewhere. I would look up how to change ENB in fo4 on google and just snag the ENB that you are wanting from MO2 with the aforementioned tip. 

I tend to not run ENB as I am mostly on my laptop due to work and this thing only has a 8gb 4060ti.

[9/25/2025 9:51 PM] ursorenda
would need to see which specific ones, but you can do some self-service by dropping them from your inv and opening console, click on the item (scroll with mouse wheel if it doesn't immediately highlight in blue) then looking at the bottom right. It'll tell you the esp that governs it's existence.


[9/25/2025 9:53 PM] ursorenda
look at your bottom left of your screen. how many green bars are there? If there's more than one, you have radiation poisoning. 

You also wanna check your IRAs using the radboy in your aid inventory. 

They're linked, I can't really be bothered to esplain it for the millionth time, check the announcements channel there's a nifty graphic we drew up that should help esplain better than my tired ass would

the short version: treat bothwith Ca-DTPA, then use a cleansing tonic. Or go see a doc and treat your radiation


[9/25/2025 9:54 PM] tannersalt
ahhhh thats where rads where i was so confsued uh yea... i have 4 bars


[9/25/2025 9:54 PM] ursorenda
since it's prolly caused by the GMoW bug, treat yoself by clicking backslash a few times (the key under your backspace) and then once the ESP explorer comes up hit R, search for Ca-DTPA and hit enter. will give you some freebies


[9/25/2025 9:55 PM] ursorenda
note the message that says "holster your weapon to heal" after use.


[9/25/2025 10:01 PM] quizzling
You can also use the cheat terminal to clear your rads by doing heal player

Having the weirdest issue. Started Far Harbor DLC recently, and almost everything I bump into now insta kills me. I am aware of the bug with bumping into cars and insta-dying, however this is almost any object - bumping against it, jumping on it. Have tested it through many save reloads. 

Anyone else dealt with this?


[9/25/2025 10:55 PM] murdock45
guess its good that i didnt update with the gmotw issues.


[9/25/2025 10:56 PM] murdock45
seems like the list is turning into radiation simulator lmfao


[9/25/2025 11:00 PM] mynt_the_derg
it's at least easily disableable.


[9/25/2025 11:01 PM] murdock45

Aight. There goes my argument out the window lmao


[9/25/2025 11:03 PM] murdock45
once you workout the russian nesting doll of workbench crafting and craft the ammo bench it becomes less of an issue


[9/25/2025 11:03 PM] mynt_the_derg
Ah so it's buried in The Workshop that I rarely fuck with got it.


[9/25/2025 11:04 PM] murdock45
yeah you have to craft a bench to craft a bench to craft more benches XD

He only opens it if you clear all the raiders inside and outside, so you might've missed one, if not then glitched


[9/25/2025 11:17 PM] murdock45
yeah once you get to diamond city its a breeze the first few hrs are tough


[9/25/2025 11:18 PM] mynt_the_derg

It wasn't for me before the update, only when I was in combat. Outside of combat it didn't drain 😄. Had a 50+ hour playthrough and it only drained when sprinting in combat, reloading (and moving), sneaking, vafs.

Hello 👋👋 all. What is stability on this mod list. I will finish install today. An I was wandering about stability and saving game. San you save wham you want if not what is stability (because crashing) and if game have crashes can you change to save when you want. I would personally.li e if it's stable and that saves are when sleeping or sitting something like that 😊😊

You can save when you want, with survival packs or cigarettes. This bypasses the sketchy script unsafe Bethesda saves. As far as stability goes, I have had less than 10 crashes related to base modpack that have mostly been fixed in about 300 hours at this point. The other crashes, I dont wanna talk about lol, I screwed some stuff up when editing things a few times lol. That was a fun day.


[9/26/2025 5:42 AM] jigsaw21101990
Lol I can imagine 🤪 but that's fantastic less that 300 crashes in 300h 👀👀👀👀 wow thx


[9/26/2025 5:44 AM] tiburse
I mean I crashed my self over 30 times in an hour. I, or more than likely one of my wife and I's cats inadvertently disabled a plugin.


[9/26/2025 5:45 AM] jigsaw21101990
Funny thing I am thinking it now is how we are waiting on next fallout so long. We just need anything broken game with good engine and moding capabilities and we will make game good because moders are more capable than game developers 😂😂😂


[9/26/2025 5:48 AM] quizzling
Instead of crashes, I just sorta get stuttering in interiors, but it usually goes away after a minute or two


[9/26/2025 5:49 AM] tiburse
Yea, the sad part is most of the fo4 engine is on a 16 bit system. thats what gives the 255 esm limit


[9/26/2025 5:49 AM] tiburse
I havent looked into Starfield much so I cant tell you what their new engine can do.

Im Lost here. Im new to the Modpack, and its killing me beyond all good. I invested 3 hours, but nearly didnt make it to red rocket. The constant radiation is killing me and i can prevent it. Even with the gas mask and hopefully a correctly replaced filter, i get radiation 14+ always and die in under a minute...
What am i doing wrong guys?

There is a screw on the right hand side, youll need to turn it counterclockwise to raise the sight to where the impact of the gun is to sight it in. 🤣 

Real talk, submit that image and one of the sight name on the gun in the #🆘support-channel. Its a texture issue that will need resolved haha.

Unless its the same gun that Dag posted, if so add your screenshots there.

[9/26/2025 4:11 PM] nomad5157
**To be released sometime this evening.**

* Fixed an issue where the master sound was set to 0.
* Updated the starting message to clearly instruct players to apply the **MCM preset only after picking up the Pip-Boy**.
* The **Gas Mask of the Wasteland** now properly applies at the start of the game (thanks to the mod author for the help ❤️ ).
* Precipitation and weather effects related to gas masks should now apply correctly.
* Fixed an issue in the Abandoned Hub where workbenches were spawning in the middle of the base.
* Fixed a texture issue with **USA flags**.
* Investigating an issue where NPCs lose clothing when wearing gas masks. For now, NPCs will not equip masks until this is fully resolved.

make sure your MCM preset is applied, go to the pause menu and exit to desktop (will commit an exit save) then reload, see if it changes the damage values of the pistol you're using

[9/26/2025 9:23 PM] krentis
is there any way to switch an eotech magnifier for the mk18 on and off on the fly or do you have to do it at a workbench each time?

as soon as i leave the vault i start dying to radiation rapidly and no meds stop the radiation what do i do


[9/26/2025 9:35 PM] destroyah707
Radiation is currently bugged, go into the mod config settings, into the Gas Masks of the Wasteland (GMOTW), Radiation, then disable radiation.


[9/26/2025 10:21 PM] nomad5157



[9/26/2025 10:25 PM] deotlc
So wait is there supposed to be constant radiation even in clear weather or is that now fixed

So i just moved to wasteland reborn due to performance. Has the recent update improve performance significantly? I got about 60 fps before.


[9/26/2025 10:27 PM] nomad5157
We always do everthing to help with performance. 60-90 is the average


[9/26/2025 10:27 PM] mynt_the_derg

My ass is running this on a old beat up laptop lol


[9/26/2025 10:28 PM] mynt_the_derg
Doesnt this game also have issues tied to fps and game speed iirc?


[9/26/2025 10:28 PM] longerlake
Solid 180 fps vs 60 and you wont go back


[9/26/2025 10:28 PM] longerlake
Theres a mod for that?


[9/26/2025 10:28 PM] longerlake
That


[9/26/2025 10:28 PM] longerlake
Every modlist has?


[9/26/2025 10:29 PM] longerlake
I think


[9/26/2025 10:29 PM] nomad5157
The list is locked to 120 fps and we will not support anything higher than that


[9/26/2025 10:29 PM] nomad5157
You can go change settings in the high fps ini


[9/26/2025 10:29 PM] longerlake
Ah fair

[9/26/2025 10:31 PM] longerlake
Well if I return to anomaly, I hope that works this time cuz I remember those settings not working at all, just kept locked at 60. Strange bug


[9/26/2025 10:32 PM] nomad5157
We did not support anything higher than 60 fps. It's not a bug just was locked to 60fps


[9/26/2025 10:32 PM] longerlake
Also with a 4060 and a i5 12th 12400f, 16 gig ram. Would i even be expected to see decent frames? Or is a upgrade in order?


[9/26/2025 10:33 PM] longerlake
Didn't know you could even do that. Neat


[9/26/2025 10:35 PM] longerlake
Also why did that tree house north of diamond city, like across that river just nuke performance? I remember that area made my game drop to 20 fps


[9/26/2025 10:35 PM] longerlake
I gotta find the location name rq


[9/26/2025 10:38 PM] longerlake
It had to do with the children of atom quest line. The one where you start your own religion


[9/26/2025 10:42 PM] ursorenda
honestly? you'd have to create a support ticket with screenshots/video for us to answer that with the fidelity someone with your candor deserves. I have no worldly idea what location you're speaking of but tbh that's mostly because I'm being pulled in like 80 different directions rn :p 


To address your hardware question: 


I rock a 4070 ti with an 11th gen cpu, tbh our graphics mods aren't that intensive it's more to do with your cpu, I think your 12th gen will be fine. Especially with the most recent update, ini changes were made that should accelerate everyone's performance


[9/26/2025 10:44 PM] ursorenda
That being said, FO4's CK engine isn't the most optimized piece of tech. My friend with a water cooled 5090 with a big f*** off cpu I can't remember has told me his machine still chugs at times, that's why we emphasize the need for a page file. Don't forget that step, please 🙂


[9/26/2025 10:48 PM] mynt_the_derg
God I kinda regret Spending so many caps on that iirc Service Rifle? I bought, whatever the one that looks like an m16 Cant remove the Carryhandle... T-T And the combat sight looks so goofy on it.


[9/26/2025 10:50 PM] ursorenda
@[Mynt] can you make a support ticket for that?


[9/26/2025 10:50 PM] mynt_the_derg
not a bug.


[9/26/2025 10:50 PM] ursorenda
I'd like to see what mean, it may be a balance issue


[9/26/2025 10:51 PM] ursorenda
specifically regarding the goofy combat sight and the un-removable carry handle)


[9/26/2025 10:51 PM] mynt_the_derg
afaik The Carry handle on it's just apart of the model. Not an actual option to remove it. Combatsight just looks goofy on it's placement atop said carryhandle.


[9/26/2025 10:52 PM] ursorenda
gotcha. How many caps did you pay for it though?


[9/26/2025 10:52 PM] mynt_the_derg
~600 ish iirc


[9/26/2025 10:52 PM] ursorenda
aahaah


[9/26/2025 10:53 PM] ursorenda
I was worried that you were gonna say like 3k or something

while I got ya here You should totally spill the beans as to where the ammo crafting stuff is under the Buildables tables. cause I cant for the life of me find it


[9/26/2025 11:08 PM] quizzling
You gotta get the ammo table, and then get a high enough Gunsmithing to see the individual ammo bps appear in the schematic bench


[9/26/2025 11:09 PM] mynt_the_derg
presumably the max of a skill is 100, And noted find ammo table.


[9/26/2025 11:10 PM] mynt_the_derg
I have gunsmithin, I just Lack alot of other things.


[9/26/2025 11:13 PM] quizzling

[9/27/2025 12:46 AM] nomad5157
Controllers are not fully supported. Community discussion is in https://discord.com/channels/1113971680419782666/1319361788730544180

We will be looking at the next update to further support them and fix current issues with them.


[9/27/2025 12:46 AM] selura
No workaround, maybe a file where I can mess around with the keybinds?

Trying to play as enclave is tough without fast travel


[9/27/2025 2:39 AM] quizzling
I have a question, the wabbajack says the pack has the Boston Riot Armor, but it doesn't appear in Mo2, is that meant to happen?


[9/27/2025 3:37 AM] lateralus9290
Do I need to redownload all the mods again? I just updated via wabbajack this time, but I'm still getting rads in clear weather without the mask.


[9/27/2025 5:15 AM] ursorenda
No, I'll ask you to create a support ticket on that one so I can network further insight


[9/27/2025 5:18 AM] ursorenda
so I played around with the new release alongside the lead dev and what we discovered is that the RAD system just *would not* update immediately relative to the weather. took approximately 1 in game hour (IIRC that's about 1 minutes IRL) 

Upon further investigation this appears to be an engine level limitation we have *no* worldly idea how to work around. The internet appears convinced it's not possible. 

For now, apply the "lore-sense" that radioactive particles dropped by rain wouldn't just *stop* being radioactive immediately after the weather cleared.


[9/27/2025 5:20 AM] ursorenda
but to answer your initial question: 

No you should not have to re-download any mods that are retained in your downloads directory


[9/27/2025 5:21 AM] lateralus9290
Thanks for checking. I started a new playthrough just in case (was only 40min in back then) and I setup the immersive preset. No rads after leaving the vault. Although I noticed that the 10mm pistol was gone. Also the pipe one that has a fixed spawn in sanctuary in one of the buildings.


[9/27/2025 5:21 AM] ursorenda
just to be sure:

You didn't find a pistol in the cage that used to hold the cryolator?


[9/27/2025 5:22 AM] lateralus9290
nope, checked the entire room twice


[9/27/2025 5:23 AM] lateralus9290
It's not a big deal as I took a preset with a shotgun, so it's fine


[9/27/2025 5:23 AM] ursorenda
if yes, please shoot a support ticket with your intial (cryo pod) save so can check things out 

If you don't have one available (understandable) may I pester you to try a fresh (new) game to see if the issue persists?


[9/27/2025 5:24 AM] ursorenda
it's a *medium* sized deal for balance reasons


[9/27/2025 5:24 AM] tiburse
I am also going to do a new save with the update as my last save has the dreaded WSFW error.


[9/27/2025 5:24 AM] ursorenda
we really have no clue why that's proc'd


[9/27/2025 5:24 AM] tiburse
Ill check it as well and provide SS to the aforementioned suppoert ticket.


[9/27/2025 5:25 AM] ursorenda
probably a non issue, but understandable


[9/27/2025 5:25 AM] tiburse
I think I forgot to remove something from the enclave stuff we had at one point


[9/27/2025 5:26 AM] ursorenda
it affected my save and that particular save had absolutely zero interaction with enclave, it's something script level that's triggering it.


[9/27/2025 5:26 AM] lateralus9290
Knowing Bethesda, the gun may have fallen under the map


[9/27/2025 5:26 AM] ursorenda
:p


[9/27/2025 5:27 AM] ursorenda
the internal memes are firing in my head rn lol


[9/27/2025 5:28 AM] ursorenda
in any event, if you happen to start a second run and it happens that the gun is still missing please create a support ticket with the save 🙂


[9/27/2025 5:31 AM] nlwalker4287
Not sure if i should just make a ticket, but getting screenshot is kind of difficult with this issue and I also don't know if its recreatable. Not finding the issue on here so it might just be me. I'm getting wonky fade in and out. actors, objects, and items. It's very inconsistent how close or far I need to be before things fade out or in. It's like they are stuck in between dimensions sometimes lmao

[9/27/2025 5:32 AM] ursorenda
that's likely an instance of installation corruption, but to be sure you'd need to provide a quick video of what you mean. best place to do that is a support ticket


[9/27/2025 5:35 AM] nlwalker4287
Yeah, I figure it has something to do with previsibines. I guess it probably is my installation

Boston Riot Armor...


[9/27/2025 6:11 AM] quizzling
I wont lie, I just sorta found another armor mod, and put it right below it


[9/27/2025 6:15 AM] ursorenda
it's not gonna be "properly" patched, but tbh it doesn't exactly need to be. I mentioned to Quiz to let me know how it works for them, @jonhyboy47 you're also very welcome to tag me in any feedback you have about it (no need to make a support ticket, it's *technically* not supposed to exist in the modpack)

If it works, great! (to answer your question, Quiz has the right idea just stick it anywhere there are armor mods)

If it works but is *terribly balanced*, not so great but  I'd still love to hear about it!

if it works and is feggin perfect, definitely let me know!

and anywhere inbetween.

to anyone else wanting to explore it? feel free. Please don't tag me. I'm asking these two users in specific to provide feedback if they so choose.

You can add it to the gasmask list if that's what you were worried about


[9/27/2025 6:55 AM] quizzling
Yeah, feel like some stuff needs to be balanced a bit


[9/27/2025 6:59 AM] jonhyboy47
Defenitly needs balance...I have a filtered system in red rocket and even like that PC gets rads with these Helmets.


[9/27/2025 7:03 AM] tiburse
I think you can turn that on in the ECO settings in MCM


[9/27/2025 7:04 AM] tiburse
Im updating my list atm, I did a dumb and tried to update without clearing the install folder and it borked itself.


[9/27/2025 7:04 AM] tiburse
So Give me about 30 min and Ill see if I can find the option


[9/27/2025 7:04 AM] tiburse
Unless you find that before me haha


[9/27/2025 7:05 AM] quizzling

Oh no shit thats wicked looking what is the setup for that?


[9/27/2025 7:14 AM] tiburse
NGL I turn it on myself, mostly due to a personal added armor set that I use has 0 resit to anything and fills all the slots.

I was looking into AAF and stuff for a lets play of the pack that Im half ass working on. Ive just been so tied up with IRL stuff that I havent had time to start it.


[9/27/2025 7:20 AM] tiburse
Just done a ton of research on it


[9/27/2025 7:20 AM] tiburse
Oh, AAF is advance animation framework


[9/27/2025 7:21 AM] jonhyboy47
Is this already in modlist? Or something else you guys add later for use for fotoshoot sessions?


[9/27/2025 7:22 AM] tiburse
I dont know if its in nor if its compatible with our list. I just know it exists and thats what a ton of the youtubers use for theirs


[9/27/2025 7:27 AM] jonhyboy47
Ok. I guess I was just looking to give another level of carisma to my screenshots from this modlist...Since I posted some yesterday but it got mi thinking I put there amateur stuff.


[9/27/2025 7:27 AM] tiburse
heh I know that feeling


[9/27/2025 7:27 AM] tiburse
its why I started looking into stuff like that


[9/27/2025 7:28 AM] tiburse
I guess part of it too is that I miss doing emotes for screenshots like I did in fo76.


[9/27/2025 7:28 AM] tiburse
grant you thats not really needed here as its singleplayer but it is nice for screenshots


[9/27/2025 7:40 AM] jonhyboy47
Sure its not needed but I just read earlier that just this guy got Nomad to complement all his awsome photos and say he will use them all in a trailer...https://discord.com/channels/1113971680419782666/1237431093813313566/1418789229143785582

[9/27/2025 9:11 AM] dagobertdogburglar
I see it’s master’d to our crafting patch and couldn’t find it in console or the mod search feature

Well this always happen to me and Im sure to someone else after updating and if using old saves...how does something like this not noticed?

[9/27/2025 10:40 AM] jonhyboy47
So im clear with this issue of mine...because I read here all the time that its fine to use old saves after updates...


[9/27/2025 10:41 AM] jonhyboy47
What I just dont undertand is how just keep playing with saves using mods removed/modified, people dont have problems...its just nonsense!


[9/27/2025 10:41 AM] jonhyboy47
At least for me...loool.


[9/27/2025 10:51 AM] tiburse
I mean some mods dont, like if its a weapon that is not a world palced one it just gets removed/replaced on the enemy/pc. If it is a world placed one, a previs made by the dev team fixes the issue of the cell its placed in going wonky.


[9/27/2025 10:51 AM] tiburse
At least as I understand it on a high level.


[9/27/2025 11:28 AM] jonhyboy47
Alright. Thanks for explaining that...But still, old saves have these records of these altered mods, so how to fix this?


[9/27/2025 11:28 AM] streikeizer
They dont touch something vanilla. Mostly only integrate them. We clean them proper before we remove something to not cause issues


[9/27/2025 11:29 AM] streikeizer
After that 9/10 times its fine


[9/27/2025 11:30 AM] streikeizer
But the later in the save there is a higher chance on issues


[9/27/2025 11:30 AM] streikeizer
Thats the truth


[9/27/2025 11:30 AM] jonhyboy47
Oh...I see now.


[9/27/2025 11:30 AM] streikeizer
And then I mean 40 hour+ saves over multiple versions


[9/27/2025 11:31 AM] streikeizer
But thats also in vanilla the case


[9/27/2025 11:31 AM] streikeizer
With save bloating etc


[9/27/2025 11:31 AM] jonhyboy47
Indeed...well Im glad I dont have anything like that.


[9/27/2025 11:32 AM] jonhyboy47
I were always ceptical...and started fresh all damm time


[9/27/2025 11:32 AM] streikeizer
Thats always the best


[9/27/2025 11:32 AM] jonhyboy47
UNTIL NOW!! So Thank you Both....


[9/27/2025 11:34 AM] streikeizer
Yeah just play as far as you want. And if you run into issues or its stated to make a new save, do that.

You can use resaver tool if you’re that concerned. Mods we remove for 99% will not cause issues


[9/27/2025 12:03 PM] jonhyboy47
Yeah I could...but I won´t. I got too much help just regarding this issue of mine. So respect and consideration is earned.

How do wabbajack modlist updates work? Never done one, just fresh installs.


[9/27/2025 12:33 PM] jonhyboy47
Delete everything from directory except downloads (backup saves elsewere too if u want)...Keep only those. Then just go to Wabbjack and let it install all over again.


[9/27/2025 12:35 PM] jonhyboy47
like that...keep only downloads.

when updating do i need to erase all downloaded mods then re download them? do i need to move my save files? The F.A.Q. says to check the "overwrite existing" checkbox? i dont see that?


[9/27/2025 2:37 PM] nlwalker4287
Just to add on to what I reported earlier. It's actually fading in and out as I stare in a direction. There's a ticket for this. Just adding extra info


[9/27/2025 2:49 PM] nomad5157
That’s a little outdated. You don’t need to delete anything. It is recommended to delete everything but downloads so you have a perfectly clean install but it’s not required


[9/27/2025 2:50 PM] sis783
so i dont need to check any box? i can just use wabajack like normal?

@The Sovereign About Riot Armor seems to be working fine but needs some minor adjustments for best balance. Have you read about what we discussed earlier?


[9/27/2025 7:24 PM] quizzling
I've had no problems with it, other than the armor not working with Nick for some reason


[9/27/2025 7:29 PM] jonhyboy47
So you tried Nick and didn't work out... What about other followers?

hi all, new here and unsure if this is the right channel to ask but -- how do you connect wires from a generator to anything? While in workshop, it says the space button will engage the connect wire action -- yet i only jump. And jumping only happens while in workshop too? There is no jump button in controls either. Any chance there's a way to fix either of those buttons?

I'm having an issue where enemies aren't loading in properly. I have all my settings to their max, yet they are only loading when I am within close range or am aiming down sights of a scope. It doesn't matter whether its clear or raining.


[9/28/2025 2:53 PM] destroyah707
I noticed it when I was doing the concord quest and enemies that would normally be spotted at a range weren't appearing for me. I would aim down the scope of my 22rifle and they would appear, yet the second I pull the scope away they would just fade.


[9/28/2025 2:57 PM] lateralus9290
I think this may be related to the issue with some objects poping in. Seems to be the same distance. But it also seems to happen outdoors only, and not all the npcs.. Not sure if there is a ticket for this, but I'd assume so

hi 10/10"s


[9/28/2025 8:42 PM] noda4i20
hahahaha if we all unite together, everyone here could record, it would be funny and awesome!
But i was saying about volume or completely disabling it, sometimes its too loud and i dont know if its an engine problem/limitation, a bug in the mod or im going crazy cause most of the time, specially indoors, it doesnt sound like its coming from the body, it sounds like its right in my ears


[9/28/2025 8:44 PM] ursorenda
has to do with how the mod is made. give me a sec


[9/28/2025 8:47 PM] ursorenda
I dont think it's tied to patches anymore. You may try disabling AnotherOne Brutal Death in MO2

Thx!! Im gonna try it rn, i kno nothing about these things yall do with patches in mods and all of that, so i just read an old message and was like "well, if i dont mess with this stuff, its not gonna break it" so i didnt want to touch anything in MO2


[9/28/2025 8:59 PM] noda4i20
I never used the creation engine with so much mods so im pretty impressed and scared on how much stuff is it running


[9/28/2025 9:09 PM] noda4i20
Nah, its now crashing on launch, i guess it still cant be disabled

[9/28/2025 9:26 PM] fignuts69
oof. running 5120x1440, all my menu text was super massive and couldn't progress through character creation. enabled the ultrawide mod in MO2 after some searching here, solved the menu issue, made a character, and now I can't even get past the start up "All systems are online" dialog box as it's too huge to click on what I assume is some sort of "OK" button. Nothing on the keyboard seems to progress it either.


[9/28/2025 9:46 PM] girgenti
is it normal for the screen to be burry when taking off the gas mask?


[9/28/2025 10:15 PM] ayedrainn
Does the latest 9/26 update resolve the combat rilfe and assult rifle bugs?


[9/28/2025 10:41 PM] heichou
Have you disabled the DPI optimizations on the .exe in the compatibility tab?


[9/28/2025 10:42 PM] fignuts69
I managed to bypass this UI \ Menu \ Ultrawide problem with the dialog box by just running the game in 1920x1080 fullscreen until after I got past that box and the game saved at the end of the vault, for anybody else that might need a workaround solution.


[9/28/2025 10:43 PM] fignuts69
If by that you mean enable "override high DPI scaling behavior" and setting to "application", yes I've done that for Fallout4.exe in both steamapps and stock folder


[9/28/2025 10:43 PM] fignuts69
It didn't change anything when I tried it


[9/28/2025 10:43 PM] heichou
Yeah I always forget the exact wording


[9/28/2025 10:43 PM] heichou
Did you do it to the .exe in the Stock Folder or your steam folder?


[9/28/2025 10:43 PM] fignuts69
Both


[9/28/2025 10:44 PM] heichou
Gotcha


[9/28/2025 10:44 PM] heichou
Had a similar issue with my 4K monitor and that's what fixed it for me

Ultrawide is a whole 'nother bothersome beast, though

this

[9/28/2025 10:45 PM] fignuts69
In game now, the UI seems to be fine, can read the pipboy just fine etc, but I haven't encountered another dialog box yet so we'll see what happens haha.


[9/28/2025 10:45 PM] fignuts69
Running 5120x1440 32:9


[9/28/2025 10:45 PM] heichou
I forget if there's a UI scale option somewhere in the MCM but it's worth looking


[9/28/2025 10:46 PM] fignuts69
Yeah, definitely gonna do some looking around once I get settled in with it. I remember having to screw around with a bunch of stuff when I tried nolvus a year or two ago for basically the same issue, dialog boxes.


[9/28/2025 10:46 PM] heichou
Have you considered


[9/28/2025 10:47 PM] heichou
a smaller monitor


[9/28/2025 10:47 PM] heichou

That's what I always think when I see em, man


[9/28/2025 10:50 PM] heichou
I just think "how many games do you play where you have to deal with black bars on both sides"


[9/28/2025 10:50 PM] mynt_the_derg
Probably most of em.


[9/28/2025 10:50 PM] mynt_the_derg
at least older titles.


[9/28/2025 10:51 PM] heichou
It's weird how games still have the 800x600 resolution option but they haven't included UW ones


[9/28/2025 10:51 PM] fignuts69
honestly? other than the bethesda titles the vast majority of other games haven't given me much issue. I was suprised at how much actually does just work out of the box with it


[9/28/2025 10:51 PM] fignuts69
sometimes FOV is an issue but that's easily solved in most cases


[9/28/2025 10:51 PM] fignuts69
the souls games can be a headache though at first


[9/28/2025 10:52 PM] mynt_the_derg
souls games my beloved


[9/28/2025 10:52 PM] heichou
Yeah that tracks. I think beth games still tie their engines to framerate, even starfield


[9/28/2025 10:52 PM] mynt_the_derg
They 100% do which is Genuinely stupid


[9/28/2025 10:52 PM] mynt_the_derg

Is there any sort of “manual” that can help explain some of the gameplay features? There’s a lot I’ve been confused about over the last 40+ hours of gameplay and some of it is starting to annoy me.


[9/28/2025 11:14 PM] new_lows_no_pizza
Like there are times where my health won’t regenerate past the halfway mark and I assume that’s radiation related but then I’ll check my radiation with the decide to show it’s below a dangerous threshold or I don’t even have any radiation.

There’s an entire guide that opens up when you install wabbajack an before you’re even allowed to launch the game


[9/29/2025 12:44 AM] nomad5157
It’s also mentioned at least one in the start up of the game

I have my PC connected to a Plasma Flatscreen TV and so far I haven't had much of an issue with Scaling and stuff.


[9/29/2025 1:09 AM] heichou
Your TV picture is probably still 16:9, though


[9/29/2025 1:10 AM] heichou
It's the UW monitor psycho aspect ratios like 32:9 that cause issues


[9/29/2025 1:10 AM] sylvithebard
huh, I learned something new today

Remember that IRAs are different from your RADs

The entire guide step 5


[9/29/2025 1:17 AM] heichou
You basically have two radiation bars


[9/29/2025 1:17 AM] heichou
One is affected by unclean food/water


[9/29/2025 1:18 AM] heichou
There are ways to soften the blow of IRAs, but you'll likely be managing it constantly until you have access to clean water and food


[9/29/2025 1:18 AM] heichou
Just carry booze/meds/chems on you that lower IRAs

[9/29/2025 1:25 AM] sylvithebard
I got a good experience with that! Got caught in a bad storm and forgot that I had my gasmask favorited, so i soaked up a lot of radiation for my first death


[9/29/2025 1:25 AM] sylvithebard
I really look forward to seeing how the modlist develops!


[9/29/2025 1:27 AM] sylvithebard
also, the paleheads and the reavers are terrifying! The music that plays when there's a palehead made me panic when I first heard the soundtrack play. the music was playing but I couldn't see the palehead yet, so when it found me, I was taken aback

you can remap it in the MCM under V.A.F.S.


[9/29/2025 9:15 AM] ursorenda
VAFS works off the same backend as VATS. Any perks or what not that affect one, affects the other. Aim is the only element where YMMV, I've seen/heard it helping and also it not affecting VAFS at all, but things like AP per shot, dmg, limb crit chance, crit chance, etc. all of that is confirmed interchangeable

So, when the game has finished installing. Would it be safe to remove the mods from the secondary folder? (The one separate from the game folder), as there’s a whole lot of space being used when I already have the mods installed within the game folder.


[9/29/2025 12:07 PM] tiburse
the downloads folder?


[9/29/2025 12:07 PM] tiburse
If so yes, keep in mind that when/if you update youll have to redownload everything rather than it just scanning and updating the ones it needs.

[9/29/2025 12:14 PM] jonhyboy47
This way is safe to delete "downloads" from modlist folder.

[9/29/2025 12:48 PM] trilliamzz
I followed the guide too the tee I really dont like asking for help its usually fairly simple but Ive been stuck on this error for 30 mins idk its pretty weird


[9/29/2025 12:49 PM] crackersss.

Fillout the bug report form, make sure you provide a screenshot of what error you’re hitting in wabba (not the log, as they will show the exact same things)


[9/29/2025 12:52 PM] tiburse
I HAVE X02 AND YOU DONT


[9/29/2025 12:52 PM] mynt_the_derg

Maybe, but goodluck when you gotta fight the army of BoS Paladins that can oneshot you through that X-02

[9/29/2025 12:55 PM] quizzling
When I did it, the Vertibird Minigun literally did no damage, and I had to suffer randomly getting 1tapped cause they dont let you out until you spin around like 4 times


[9/29/2025 12:56 PM] tiburse
You can mini nuke the main catwalk from the top of the airport control tower


[9/29/2025 12:56 PM] tiburse
Just need good aim with the drop

[9/29/2025 12:57 PM] quizzling
Airport?


[9/29/2025 12:57 PM] quizzling
I meant the Army Depot


[9/29/2025 12:57 PM] tiburse
Oh Im talking clearing out the Pryd


[9/29/2025 12:57 PM] quizzling
I don't think you actually destroy the Pryd as the Enclave tbh


[9/29/2025 12:58 PM] tiburse
Sorry, food coma + wife talking  to me at the same time.


[9/29/2025 12:58 PM] tiburse
I DID LOL


[9/29/2025 12:58 PM] tiburse
At least killed everyone on it.


[9/29/2025 12:58 PM] tiburse
They did my boy dirty once they found out what he is.


[9/29/2025 12:59 PM] tiburse
I wonder if that reduces the ones in the depot....


[9/29/2025 1:14 PM] ursorenda
you uh.... understand that the enclave would do the same thing, right?


[9/29/2025 1:18 PM] quizzling
Literally part of the Enclave quest is the General wanting the synth of his daughter dead cause he sees them as Abominations


[9/29/2025 1:19 PM] quizzling
I went with the Whitehill path


[9/29/2025 1:21 PM] quizzling
An Enclave path I can get behind


[9/29/2025 1:28 PM] mynt_the_derg
iirc isnt the enclave an offshoot of the brotherhood? or the otherway around.


[9/29/2025 1:28 PM] quizzling
Technically neither


[9/29/2025 1:28 PM] quizzling
But if anything BoS is the offshoot


[9/29/2025 1:33 PM] mynt_the_derg
one of the two.


[9/29/2025 1:34 PM] quizzling
BoS was founded only a few days before the great war, and was technically defectors from the US Army, the Enclave were select members of the US Government, Army, an stuff like that

{Reactions}
literallythis

[9/29/2025 1:34 PM] tiburse
What gets me is that the author of AE2 chose to go down the same path thats caused the enclave to get ended 987465132 times at this point.... Global genocide through FEV.


[9/29/2025 1:34 PM] tiburse
TBH Id love to see a "good guy" enclave for a change


[9/29/2025 1:34 PM] tiburse
perhaps the Corrupted Modus could help with that


[9/29/2025 1:35 PM] quizzling
That's what the Whitehill path sorta changes, she just puts the FEV into grenades cause she's worried doing the previous would unite the wasteland against them


[9/29/2025 1:36 PM] tiburse
I mean still


[9/29/2025 1:36 PM] tiburse
Its using FEV


[9/29/2025 1:36 PM] tiburse
Im so sick of FEV as the end all be all at this point. Might just be a me issue.


[9/29/2025 1:37 PM] quizzling
Imagine an Enclave mod that see them looking for a GECK or something like that


[9/29/2025 1:37 PM] quizzling
Kinda makes me wanna make something like that into a mod, but by god do I know my motivation wouldn't let me finish it


[9/29/2025 1:40 PM] tiburse
Omg, Id love that like they get a geck fight to form a shady sands/vault city style settlement


[9/29/2025 1:40 PM] tiburse
Ya know. Id love that in general as like a thing for players


[9/29/2025 1:40 PM] tiburse
Like rebuild AIO but you have to source a GECK before being able to "rebuild" the settlement


[9/29/2025 1:41 PM] tiburse
and it restores it almost to a pre war state


[9/29/2025 1:41 PM] quizzling
Use the GECK in Spectacle Island


[9/29/2025 1:43 PM] quizzling
The Notclave has to fight against the Institute because they also want the GECK to enhance their Synthetic plants into something much closer to the real thing


[9/29/2025 1:43 PM] tiburse
YES


[9/29/2025 1:43 PM] tiburse
I LOVE THIS


[9/29/2025 1:45 PM] tiburse
Or even if you kill father and side the institute with the enclave in an "Unlikely Alliances" quest they GECK the island and build a completely safe city and start restoring the Commonwealth


[9/29/2025 1:46 PM] quizzling
The BoS hates the Notclave on principle, and the latter doesn't forgive the BoS for indiscriminately killing them even if they defected, but you can broker a truce if you make your choices well, and make friends in high places


[9/29/2025 1:46 PM] quizzling
The Railroad doesn't matter


[9/29/2025 1:48 PM] tiburse
Heh, Synthesizers.


[9/29/2025 1:49 PM] quizzling
Part of the questline sees a group break off and become and/or recruit Gunners that keep being a thorn in your side that you have to eventually deal with


[9/29/2025 1:49 PM] quizzling
Because they don't see why they have to help the weak wasteland when America is theirs by right


[9/29/2025 1:51 PM] tiburse
Mhm, Im digging this thought process. However, I have no clue how to create something on such a grand scale. Hell, Im still trying to get new textures to mesh on old skeletons correctly for a mod I want to make that does not exist yet.


[9/29/2025 1:52 PM] quizzling
Yeah neither tbh, Im good at ideas, and when my motivation hits I can speedthrough learning and shit, but usually its hard for me to even find the motivation


[9/29/2025 1:56 PM] tiburse

This update adds gas mask to Fallout Anomaly, making the weather deadly. Rain,storms,and other hazardous weather now expose you to heavy radiation.

Anomaly default 
Easy preset
Immersion Preset

[9/29/2025 4:21 PM] corbboss477
gpt said it was a problem with the file directories being longer than windows can handle, so i shortned the name of the folder and it didnt work lol, but then it said it was a bad file so i deleted it and wabbajak redownloaded it and now it seems to be working, still installing for now though so no guarentee

Is there a way to change the button for butchery? Or do something with it? I often just loot without opening the body, but this is F by default and it keeps opening the butcher menu. This wouldnt be a problem for animals, but now it opens up on humans as well. It also opens when transfering larger number of items where F is used to confirm. I keep cutting up people just so that I can then throw out the pieces 😄

[9/29/2025 5:51 PM] blurryfaceandrew
Why do workbenches give to options to basically add mods to guns that do an infinite amount of damage and add any improvements you want? What’s the point of leveling or doing  gunsmiths builds if you can just break everything  with thosse workbench optionss


[9/29/2025 5:53 PM] mynt_the_derg
afaik it's an option from said gun mod. imo it's a in mod cheat tool.


[9/29/2025 5:54 PM] mynt_the_derg
~~With how damage works you really dont need it anyways~~


[9/29/2025 5:54 PM] corbboss477
is my game busted or is the resolution weird for everyone in game? like in the menu anyway, its fine while im walking around


[9/29/2025 5:54 PM] corbboss477
and how do i change res on the game


[9/29/2025 6:02 PM] blurryfaceandrew
Idk having a cheat tool being incorporated into workbenches and your Pipboy kinda breaks the immersion or atleast cheapens the survival aspect of things


[9/29/2025 6:03 PM] mynt_the_derg
I'm not the one who made those weapon mods. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯


[9/29/2025 6:04 PM] ursorenda
I thiink he's refering to some of the legendary mods you can add that LEO brings, like the cannon ball mod which currently adds like 4k dmg per shot


[9/29/2025 6:06 PM] blurryfaceandrew
it’s the settings in workbenches that you can set to on or off and if you set it to on it adds these custom mods you can add that allow you to set basically any value idk I guess it would be easier to ignore if it was just in the background unseen


[9/29/2025 6:06 PM] mynt_the_derg
thought he was talking about the +x% dmg mod some guns have ¯\_(ツ)_/¯


[9/29/2025 6:06 PM] ursorenda
ahhhhh I see. he is, there's a mod that allows you to add that to all guns


[9/29/2025 6:07 PM] ursorenda
I forget which mod adds tthat but for now you'll just have to not use the feature my friend


[9/29/2025 6:07 PM] ursorenda
workshop stuff is getting a whole overhaul, in the interim bear with us


[9/29/2025 6:09 PM] blurryfaceandrew
Okay fair enough, I know it’s present in almost every modlist for fallout 4 so most people must like it


[9/29/2025 6:09 PM] ursorenda
weeee do not


[9/29/2025 6:10 PM] ursorenda
things like the cheat terminal are only included as a sort of "we understand that things can break, it's a beta" workaround. 

That particular function with the workbench was added unintentionally, or rather wasn't disabled when we added the mod responsible. Our lead dev is a bit of a sadist so he'd never had approved it had we known prior.


[9/29/2025 6:15 PM] blurryfaceandrew
I’m glad it’s actually thought about at least , when it’s in Magnum Opus I expect that since throwing in everything and making the game as easy and broken as possible is the point of that kind of modlist I guess


[9/29/2025 6:19 PM] corbboss477
does anyone know how to fix the resolution problem or do i need to make a ticket?


[9/29/2025 6:28 PM] mynt_the_derg
What exactly is the resolution problem? Is the game sort of minimized in a corner or something?


[9/29/2025 6:32 PM] corbboss477
yeah its launching with like a 3rd of my screen using the top left


[9/29/2025 6:33 PM] corbboss477
once im in moving its fine but menus and stuff are hardly usuable


[9/29/2025 6:33 PM] ursorenda
do a search for DPI Scaling

[9/29/2025 6:33 PM] corbboss477
Ok


[9/29/2025 6:36 PM] corbboss477
i think ive followed what im supposed to do for the DPI scaling but in the properties of the game its already checked for application


[9/29/2025 6:37 PM] corbboss477
or should i be disabling it


[9/29/2025 6:37 PM] ursorenda
it should be disabled


[9/29/2025 6:37 PM] corbboss477
oh ok ill try that


[9/29/2025 6:37 PM] ursorenda
wait sorry


[9/29/2025 6:37 PM] ursorenda

[9/29/2025 6:37 PM] ursorenda
are you certain you're augmenting the properties of the fallout4.exe in the stock folder? not your steam installation folder?


[9/29/2025 6:40 PM] corbboss477
no i believe i am doing it through steam


[9/29/2025 6:40 PM] corbboss477
is there a fallout4.exe for anomaly specifically?


[9/29/2025 6:40 PM] ursorenda
where you installed FOA there's a folder called stock folder


[9/29/2025 6:40 PM] ursorenda
inside is a separate fallout4.exe


[9/29/2025 6:40 PM] corbboss477
oh ok ill check that then thanks


[9/29/2025 6:41 PM] ursorenda
your saves, should you ever need them, are in the profiles folder of your installation directory for FOA

[9/29/2025 7:09 PM] mynt_the_derg
"Mexican Cola"


[9/29/2025 7:10 PM] mynt_the_derg
aka fancy shmancy glass bottle coke


[9/29/2025 7:10 PM] mkdevst8r
it doesnt fullfill the requirement for the crafting recipes sadly


[9/29/2025 7:10 PM] mynt_the_derg
Huh weird.


[9/29/2025 7:10 PM] mkdevst8r
maybe i need the mixing station to make my own


[9/29/2025 7:11 PM] mkdevst8r
also not sure what the water purifying chip goes into if anyone could shed some light


[9/29/2025 7:13 PM] quizzling
Settlement Water Purifiers


[9/29/2025 7:13 PM] mkdevst8r
Dang, i can only use a ground water pump here.


[9/29/2025 7:14 PM] quizzling
Yeah, water chips are needed for settlements to get purified water instead of dirty water


[9/29/2025 7:14 PM] mkdevst8r
bummer, i guess ill hgave to look into that water purifying station then


[9/29/2025 7:14 PM] mkdevst8r
Red rocket has no large bodies of water sadly


[9/29/2025 7:16 PM] quizzling
Downside of the station is that I think it needed to be assigned


[9/29/2025 7:18 PM] mkdevst8r
Well it seems to be the only option for inland settlements to get Purified Water sooo.. gotta do what ya gotta do i guess haha

[9/29/2025 7:20 PM] quizzling
You can build a vault sink and if you have bottles, filling them at the sink will give you purified water


[9/29/2025 7:20 PM] mkdevst8r
that could certainly help haha thanks


[9/29/2025 7:21 PM] mynt_the_derg
only issue after that is Getting bottles consistently


[9/29/2025 7:22 PM] quizzling
You can make em at a chem bench if you have glass


[9/29/2025 7:22 PM] mynt_the_derg
iirc at the Cooking station as well


[9/29/2025 7:22 PM] mynt_the_derg
had difficulty with those ones tho cause it doesnt seem to register multiple crafts half the time


[9/29/2025 7:24 PM] quizzling
You'd just need to remember to build bottles, then fill, then build more bottles, cause if you just keep building, it'll use those previous bottles as junk glass


[9/29/2025 7:24 PM] mynt_the_derg
huh, more you know that'd be why I was having issues

[9/29/2025 8:40 PM] lizardwizard5338
Sorry, I am just a litte confused on where I can get help with something. The Rules channel says I should consult the support page which I did and then if I still need assistance to go to a different channel that I don't have access to. Should I just create a ticket in the #🆘support-channel ?


[9/29/2025 8:40 PM] fignuts69
Does this have a slowmo\bullet time alternative to vats like in some of the other 3\NV modpacks? If not, is there a way to incorporate it without breaking stuff? I haven't even really started playing yet, just wondering


[9/29/2025 8:50 PM] quizzling
This replaces normal VATS with a Slowmo version


[9/29/2025 8:52 PM] fignuts69

[9/29/2025 8:53 PM] fignuts69
this is the first modlist that made me actually interested in picking up fallout 4 again. i haven't played since release, pretty much hated it after my first two playthroughs and left it alone since


[9/29/2025 8:54 PM] quizzling
Not even stuff like Far Harbor or Nuka World?


[9/29/2025 8:55 PM] fignuts69
I tried Far Harbor when it came out, but I put the whole thing down before Nuka World. I did dig the atmosphere of Far Harbor from what I can remember. The plus side is this is basically going to be a blind playthrough again as I don't remember much of the vanilla game. Boy in fridge, dad\son robots n shit and a blimp. lmao


[9/29/2025 8:56 PM] fignuts69

[9/29/2025 8:57 PM] fignuts69
so far I've only made it out of the vault and even that little bit feels way better than what I remember from vanilla, and from what I've read about the modpack it seems very promising


[9/29/2025 8:58 PM] quizzling

[9/29/2025 11:29 PM] jay_raughed
Has anybody else had issues finding the Mk18 in leveled lists? I feel like I'm missing something as I've been unable to find it from vendors or drops and the quest hasn't popped up for me yet (An Operators Best Friend (I think)). I'm about lvl 40 and have found weapons like the "Service Rifle" or "SPR" but not the "MK18" (by FX0x01). Now I hate cheating, but if anybody else is having this problem you could hypothetically use console commands to spawn it in (player.additem 80000F9D). Which is what I had to do sadly.


[9/29/2025 11:30 PM] mynt_the_derg
I have to wonder why the spr is considered a "pistol" at least according to the inv icon


[9/29/2025 11:30 PM] jay_raughed
The shoulder mounted .50 is also considered a pistol 😂


[9/29/2025 11:31 PM] mynt_the_derg
yeah I remember seeing that lmao


[9/29/2025 11:32 PM] jay_raughed
But that's just a glyph, I don't think the stats are affected from perks like gunslinger. But I could be absolutely wrong.


[9/29/2025 11:32 PM] mynt_the_derg
would be absurd if it was lmao


[9/29/2025 11:33 PM] jay_raughed
That would suck because the .50 has been a 'get out of jail free' card for me as of late moving into the late game. 1-shots everything including deathclaws and the Enclave.


[9/29/2025 11:34 PM] mynt_the_derg
I mean... it is .50 cal


[9/29/2025 11:34 PM] mynt_the_derg
I'd expect something like that to pierce powerarmor


[9/29/2025 11:35 PM] jay_raughed
Yeah, it's awesome. They definitely make .50 feel about as powerful as it should be.


[9/29/2025 11:35 PM] mynt_the_derg
or wahtever ammunition the Typically mounted Turrets, use.


[9/29/2025 11:35 PM] mynt_the_derg

I have a bad history with the akm...

if you don't mind the bulky ass model, the SAW is also really nice in close range

suprised it works for you, I think I may have missed that correctitin in a changelog or two but I tried it thinking I was getting a .308 alt and was disappointed


[9/29/2025 11:47 PM] mynt_the_derg
At least for human enemies, Single bodyshot downs em, headshots for mutants.


[9/29/2025 11:47 PM] mynt_the_derg
limb shot Not so much of course.


[9/29/2025 11:47 PM] ursorenda
mootants don't beeg boolets


[9/29/2025 11:47 PM] mynt_the_derg
but at the same time it *is* from stealth so I do have the dmg modifier


[9/29/2025 11:49 PM] mynt_the_derg
at the same time headshot on mutants is pretty easy, unless I'm getting a fkn rocket or nade thrown at me.


[9/29/2025 11:51 PM] ursorenda
because MAIM limb shots will *probably* never kill


[9/29/2025 11:51 PM] mynt_the_derg
it *can* Disarm :)


[9/29/2025 11:51 PM] ursorenda
not until the limb has been zero'd, then it affects hp

took a nap in the city near iirc an added playerhome, came out 3 squads of raiders.

first time coming out was a mutant suicider Right outside the door


[9/30/2025 12:01 AM] ursorenda
just with a trigger of "time since last injury" and "time since last death"


[9/30/2025 12:01 AM] ursorenda
IF I can get it working correctly, you might be spared my wrath if I can't figure it out :p


[9/30/2025 12:02 AM] ursorenda
I like that idea too. We also like the idea of locking the more unique weapons behind quests and factions


[9/30/2025 12:03 AM] ursorenda

[9/30/2025 12:08 AM] quizzling
Would also like the see more weapon types that are sorta specific to factions, the institute has a bunch of their own guns, would be cool to see the Minutemen or Railroad use more stuff the others dont


[9/30/2025 12:09 AM] mynt_the_derg
Minutemen having their own weaponry would be nice

[9/30/2025 12:18 AM] ursorenda
our current position is: 

we cannot split our attention between the massive changes in 0.6.0 and maintaining a playable, enjoyable state in 0.5.8

A lot of those changes to things like factions and their visual and functional identities were started in the buildout for 0.5.7.7 but we quickly realized we would need to flesh out foundational systems before we'd be able to realize the vision. The decision was made to shift our greater focus to 0.6.0 with some serious reworks. 

We wanna add all of that but it will be in 0.6.1/0.6.2


[9/30/2025 12:18 AM] ursorenda
the hope is that we can begin building custom content to release for 0.7.0

Bunker hill there is a guy in powerarmor who can teach you for caps

[9/30/2025 1:45 PM] themasterspy
how much caps?

Little tip I can give you for caps is grab heather as a follower and then every bandit camp grab EVERYTHING and sell to her she has like 5k caps for bartering


[9/30/2025 1:48 PM] maxblackanvil
Where is heather


[9/30/2025 1:48 PM] themasterspy

I wouldn’t actually know, but I do know the element you described is governed by fallui, immerseive ui wouldn’t


[9/30/2025 2:15 PM] deotlc
Well in immersive ui they have a thing for 3rd person crosshair but it just doesnt show up or change anything when messed with


[9/30/2025 2:16 PM] ursorenda
Immersive ui is very old and often unreliable, that’s why we use fallui on top

New update sounds great! Not sure exactly what it entails but as someone who recently started playing this pack for the first time, I had a terribly difficult time navigating the initial levels as far as medicine goes, particularly Rad/IRA related medicines. There is a surprising lack of pure rad/IRS removal tools and inject those yellow pens(forgot the name) 10 times just to lower rads was ROUGH

That was until I stumbled upon Heather 😂


[9/30/2025 2:38 PM] mkdevst8r
A field hospital should certainly help a bit


[9/30/2025 3:41 PM] mynt_the_derg
Rads are no Joke... And Gas masks are kinda a necessity.


[9/30/2025 5:24 PM] lizardwizard5338
Does this have some kind of Achievement enabler so that mods don't disable them?


[9/30/2025 5:45 PM] nomad5157
yes

this pack doesnt have the portable workbench right? i thought it did but maybe ive been playing too many other modlists


[9/30/2025 6:13 PM] maru_cci
Hello good people, been having a blast with the modlist. I have a question, is there a way to loot a body without opening that harvesting menu?


[9/30/2025 6:14 PM] murdock45
i was told to just change the bind


[9/30/2025 6:14 PM] maru_cci
Oh, just that? alright


[9/30/2025 6:15 PM] maru_cci
what button did you use for harvesting?


[9/30/2025 6:16 PM] murdock45
i havent done it yet


[9/30/2025 6:17 PM] murdock45
just woke up lol


[9/30/2025 6:19 PM] maru_cci
lol


[9/30/2025 6:19 PM] maru_cci
anyway, i still dont know what the harvesting is used for


[9/30/2025 6:20 PM] maru_cci
havent read the entire modlist


[9/30/2025 6:20 PM] maru_cci
but i guess ill find out just by playing


[9/30/2025 6:20 PM] murdock45
well before it was for harvesting parts for animals


[9/30/2025 6:21 PM] murdock45
but the whole harvesting human corpses thing is kinda weird ngl


[9/30/2025 6:21 PM] maru_cci
oh i though it was for some kind of fleshsmith stuff


[9/30/2025 6:21 PM] maru_cci
that mod for automaton


[9/30/2025 6:21 PM] maru_cci
that you can create robot with parts of creatures and people


[9/30/2025 6:21 PM] maru_cci
XD


[9/30/2025 6:25 PM] murdock45
its from hunter of the commonwealth IIRC


[9/30/2025 6:26 PM] murdock45
if you want to look it up


[9/30/2025 6:26 PM] murdock45
tho i thought you had to take the cannibal perk to dismantle corpses but idk ive slept since then lol


[9/30/2025 7:38 PM] mynt_the_derg
Rebound it to P, harvesting is how you get meat, hides, bones and other animal related drops also how you loot legendary equipment from said mons


[9/30/2025 7:58 PM] mkdevst8r
Nah it's the tissue damage that's the problem. 1 rad and 1 IRA = tissue damage with no way of curing cause there's no doctors anywhere near the start


[9/30/2025 8:03 PM] nomad5157
One at drumlin diner which is like 5 minutes from start...also can make meds pretty early on. Also in vault there is a cache of meds


[9/30/2025 8:03 PM] mkdevst8r

Someone help me resolve this? I’ve tried eating, sleeping, and hydrating (none of which have seemingly been working during 40+ hours of gameplay because they’ve never came up once) and now I keep falling down and having this prompt

[9/30/2025 9:30 PM] fignuts69
lol well this was weird. snuck into the concord bakery, filled with raiders, held my own until the last one killed me, no biggie. Reloaded the last save, made my way there again, place was empty this time cool no problem. Made my way to the top floor, did some looting, smoked and saved on the top floor, quit the game to do whatever, started back up and loaded the save and immediately die from an explosion. Reload the same save, no explosion, but the place is filled with unarmed raiders now :kekg:


[9/30/2025 9:56 PM] nomad5157

Cambridge polymer labs has 1-2. However, before the update, it broke right after I approached a glowing one, not sure if it was a bug or not, since there was no 'durability' on the item to check.


[10/1/2025 11:50 AM] quizzling
Might just be the gasmask mod durability thing


[10/1/2025 11:51 AM] fazoki

Didn't think that would ping you, soz bruzzuh
But in this second ping I will use helpful keywords for other users searching for this problem such as pop in and view distance and fade in and LOD and probably other ways to describe it :Pepo_Hearts:


[10/2/2025 1:04 AM] fignuts69
also, turning off cloud shadows via ENB settings got rid of that huge circle \ halo \ radius of shadow around the player while outdoors. The Sun casting no shadows constantly looks good in a few screen shots but moving around the world and seeing that distance barrier of shadow \ light got weird fast

Hi - I just have a quick question. I start the game and my screen goes black while Fallout takes up only 1/4th of my screen, sitting up in the top left all snug and smug. My BethINI settings are adjusted properly to my display (2560x1600), yet the issue persists. What do I do to fix or where do I go to get help with this?


[10/2/2025 7:58 PM] vextin
Something something dpi scaling


[10/2/2025 7:58 PM] vextin
Right click the exe I think?


[10/2/2025 8:03 PM] masterthor

See above image. Make sure High DPI checkbox is checked and application is selected for the Fallout4.exe in the Stock Folder of your mod install.


[10/2/2025 8:11 PM] tiburse
Its an issue with Fallout 4s engine not liking anything higher than 1080 lol. Easy fix thankfully.

I heard Uranium Fever is really good, I usually make my own list for TTW, cause it's not as complicated as 4 and Skyrim to make a list for


[10/3/2025 11:54 AM] quizzling

Anyone have any idea how or where to find the full suit and/or locations? 

I bought this from the Synth in the Lexington Pharmacy a while ago and haven’t found any other pieces since. I purchased all of the ‘Synth PA’ mods but no idea what they can be used with. 

Any clues are welcomed.

[10/4/2025 1:53 AM] quizzling
You need to level the Gunsmithery skill, you get a new rank of the perk every 25 points you put into it


[10/4/2025 2:30 AM] mynt_the_derg
Level up the skill. Same goes for Other Crafting related perks

HOW do you not instantly die from mines?


[10/4/2025 5:03 AM] jigsaw21101990
Does anyone have guide for crafting or at least how to make new gas mask filters 👀


[10/4/2025 5:11 AM] deleteduser7329
is tranfer setlments compatible with this


[10/4/2025 5:18 AM] ursorenda
loosely, YMMV


[10/4/2025 5:18 AM] ursorenda
That would be in direct line with whatever the Gas Mask of The Wasteland mod has


[10/4/2025 5:19 AM] ursorenda
you wouldn't. mines are lethal, like IRL


[10/4/2025 5:22 AM] ursorenda
though I will say, i've had limited luck sprinting like a mad man the moment I hear the trigger


[10/4/2025 5:23 AM] deleteduser7329
so why does this mod still use the old gen of the game but it asked me to update before instal


[10/4/2025 5:24 AM] deleteduser7329
ps im using wobblejack


[10/4/2025 5:24 AM] ursorenda
good ol wobblejack


[10/4/2025 5:24 AM] callmebigpappi
you can craft gas mask filters at a chem station


[10/4/2025 5:25 AM] ursorenda
there's a whole process that's automated via wabbajack. I can't speak to the very specific reason, but I can tell you that if you don't it doesn't install correctly


[10/4/2025 5:25 AM] ursorenda
part of that is a downgrader that's run through wabbajack]


[10/4/2025 5:26 AM] deleteduser7329
ok its weird i used the old version of transfer settlements and it still asked for the f4se 7.2


[10/4/2025 5:26 AM] deleteduser7329
when in game


[10/4/2025 5:27 AM] deleteduser7329
i used like 1.92 for the old gen


[10/4/2025 5:28 AM] ursorenda
the downgrader will downgrade the Fallout 4 version. It will not downgrade your F4SE. 

if a mod requires a newer version of F4SE you would  be wise to downgrade the mod in question to the one that requires the version of F4SE that we use. We will not support anything else


[10/4/2025 5:38 AM] jigsaw21101990
Thx


[10/4/2025 5:39 AM] demon6669747
that does not seem to work for me


[10/4/2025 5:40 AM] ursorenda
perhaps I should have emphasized "limited"


[10/4/2025 5:41 AM] ursorenda
if I notice the mines before approaching, I have limited success evading them. 

If I don't, it almost *always* results in death


[10/4/2025 5:41 AM] ursorenda
for what it's worth.... this remains commensurate for my enemies, as well. 🙂


[10/4/2025 5:42 AM] ursorenda
I don't mean to belittle you or anyone else, this modpack is focused very directly towards realism


[10/4/2025 5:43 AM] ursorenda
if you know anyone who successfully evaded a mine in the real world.... please have them contact us


[10/4/2025 5:45 AM] ursorenda
we would love to use their experience to translate our realism focus towards better, more enjoyable gameplay


[10/4/2025 5:47 AM] jigsaw21101990
I agree 💯% it's not realistic if you step on mine to live through it


[10/4/2025 5:48 AM] jigsaw21101990

at the end point we'd love to do major quest overhauls. We don't have specific end points because we try to stay systems-first. once we reach 1.0 we'll understand what we can work with, and realistically the real meat n' potatoes will come with 1.1.0 🙂

[10/4/2025 6:31 AM] yami_ger
I mean in the end i would also be happy with a deathclaw in the vault or outside cuz couy place secure and easy to overview


[10/4/2025 6:32 AM] ursorenda
For… protection


[10/4/2025 6:34 AM] yami_ger
That aswell like even after 200 years and the stuff the institute did and maybe other factions i wouldnt be surprised if a deathclaw could nist down there after all they climb and all


[10/4/2025 6:34 AM] ursorenda
I mean, deathclaw as soon as you wake up is a bit much


[10/4/2025 6:35 AM] ursorenda
But I agree that life should be *very* differently represented

[10/4/2025 9:20 AM] demon6669747
Well I mean healing crippled limbs so many times I dont think is realistic either but being a crippled for the rest of the game isnt fun.
My grudge is mostly with the mines placement more than their lethality (with most explosions lethality and range actually), like who tf put the mine inside the car in front of the giant robot place??
That combined with the saves only by cigarettes and sleeping making me redo the entire last 15 mins and the almost constant inventory management is annoying af to me.
At least for easy mode lets not have such random mines and so lethal and such range.


[10/4/2025 9:20 AM] demon6669747
Apart from that I love the modlist so far.

[10/4/2025 1:11 PM] nomad5157
The current version we haven't really messed that much with mine placement so tbh what you are running across might just be vanilla.


[10/4/2025 1:14 PM] mynt_the_derg
Or that one iirc sneak perk that stops you from tripping traps and mines


[10/4/2025 1:15 PM] mynt_the_derg
Mines are also kinda (same in vanilla) easy to spot. They arent buried like irl. If you’re fast enough you can disarm it before exploding


[10/4/2025 1:25 PM] yami_ger

[10/4/2025 2:50 PM] ursorenda
Vramr will do it. Fun fact you can reduce the textures so low it looks like a PS1 game, our resident Vramr guy has shared some particularly off putting screenshots (disclaimer, we don't officially support Vramr, but one of our devs wrote a guide on using it https://discord.com/channels/1113971680419782666/1414411340373561374)


[10/4/2025 2:51 PM] umonclair
ya i was looking through that


[10/4/2025 2:51 PM] ursorenda
to save you some time, his input won't likely make Vramr take less time. it's a crunchy app that brute forces things


[10/4/2025 2:51 PM] umonclair
is there anything else i can do for the time being?

not really, that's essentially the "option" while we're still in beta. There's enough request from the community to include tiered graphical options for lower systems that *eventually* it will be offered but for now, Vramr is it

"This part of the pack sucks..." > "that's vanilla" is hilarious


[10/4/2025 5:18 PM] vextin
I've been playing a lot of vanilla lately (not in a position to create more stress for myself by playing a difficult pack rn) and some of the design decisions are just 🤦‍♂️


[10/4/2025 5:33 PM] zrtec1
My main concern is playing the game without any form of auto saves. Where trying to find a bed to just sleep for an hour is pretty punishing.

Thank God the game doesn't crash but ive lost hours worth of progress forgetting to save.


[10/4/2025 5:33 PM] zrtec1
Skill issue but still, I'd rather just play some other form of the pack.

(Also suppose I could just alter the mcm to do autosaves)


[10/4/2025 5:43 PM] nomad5157
Is it that much of trouble just to keep cigarettes' on you? You can hotkey them.

NVM FOUND THIS


[10/4/2025 5:54 PM] ursorenda
You can try it out. The devs have informed me the worst that will happen is attribute values will be out of whack for guns and armors added


[10/4/2025 5:56 PM] mkdevst8r
im honestly not well versed enough with modding to bother experimenting too much. i can do some really basic trouble shooting stuff but id rather not do anything too crazy for a single armor i think is cool lol


[10/4/2025 5:56 PM] mkdevst8r
ive been looking around for a while trying to find that "perfect armor" haha, had the one im using now for like 40 lvls and want a change, but i dont want to sacrifice my legendary armor pieces. its hard finding something that looks good that only takes up the chest


[10/4/2025 5:57 PM] mkdevst8r
only decent one ive found so far is the minuteman uniform wich ive been using since concord


[10/4/2025 6:33 PM] weabootyler
Havent updated the pack before, is it easy to do or nah?


[10/4/2025 6:40 PM] weabootyler

[10/4/2025 7:10 PM] mkdevst8r
only annoying thing is that if you have installed any extra mods yourself you have to reinstall them, and also re enable any optional mods in the list. 

Also have to redo the MCM config in game


[10/4/2025 7:11 PM] mkdevst8r
ive heard from multiple ppl sim settlements doesnt work great w this pack. if you really hate doing settlements just use prefabs, homemaker has some decent ones, i also like thematic and practical for some vendor related items

that will be in the concord church basement once you unlock it

Thanks for the response! I did this and nothing has changed sadly. I never edited settings either. The input just says "[space] attach wire." And also the jumping action isn't even in the pause screen/settings/control assignments. Attempting to connect wires in workshop (spacebar) just makes me jump, which isn't a function outside of workshop in the game itself?


[10/4/2025 11:22 PM] fearhubert
^and the spacebar is nowhere to be found/assigned on that pause screen/settings/controls panel

There's certainly a way to do it but we won't be sharing it, as it breaks several things in our modpack. If you feel adventurous you can figure it out without too much effort but don't complain when your game breaks. 

Also the function you're looking for is inside the esp explorer. backslash, the key under your backspace key. you may have to mash it a few times.


[10/5/2025 5:58 AM] ursorenda
you just need to reload the game. It's a weird thing


[10/5/2025 5:58 AM] deleteduser7329
yeah i realised i nedd to relaod after i set everyhting'


[10/5/2025 5:59 AM] deleteduser7329
also i thing tranfer setlments works with it


[10/5/2025 5:59 AM] ursorenda
I'll check whether it does but it *should* say that you should save and reload after setting MCM preset


[10/5/2025 5:59 AM] ursorenda
it'll work for the most part, yes


[10/5/2025 6:00 AM] ursorenda
things like SS2 will also work but with all things settlements, you're contributing to save bloat


[10/5/2025 6:00 AM] ursorenda
we don't include it because we want to present the most stable experience we can


[10/5/2025 6:00 AM] ursorenda
also workshop framework does the exact same thing


[10/5/2025 6:01 AM] deleteduser7329
also i removed the companion tweeks so i could use unlimited companion frame work did i break anything game seems to be working fine


[10/5/2025 6:01 AM] deleteduser7329
you can tranfer setlments with it?


[10/5/2025 6:02 AM] ursorenda
uh.... I don't think that's patch dependent but you can file that under "we didn't include it so we won't provide support for it"

I would like to know how you like it after a while, though. AFT is a tad bit buggy, so is UCF. when you feel confident can you make a post in https://discord.com/channels/1113971680419782666/1364208073060651048 ?


[10/5/2025 6:03 AM] ursorenda
yeah it's just not as user friendly on the GUI. but it does *literally* the same thing


[10/5/2025 6:06 AM] deleteduser7329
i like having like three companions i usually set up a small tac squad with them


[10/5/2025 6:07 AM] deleteduser7329
i will look into that


[10/5/2025 6:07 AM] ursorenda
.... AFT allows that as well


[10/5/2025 6:08 AM] ursorenda
up to 5


[10/5/2025 6:08 AM] ursorenda
but no need to change things


[10/5/2025 6:08 AM] deleteduser7329
it would not work when i tried


[10/5/2025 6:08 AM] ursorenda
like I said, I'd like to see how things work for you, in your own words


[10/5/2025 6:08 AM] ursorenda
idk why it wouldn't, likely that you didn't set the MCM setting to increase from 2 to 3


[10/5/2025 6:08 AM] ursorenda
😛


[10/5/2025 6:09 AM] deleteduser7329
they are also all stand alone companions

[10/5/2025 6:22 AM] ursorenda
be very careful with scrap everything


[10/5/2025 6:22 AM] ursorenda
you can break previs and generally the game with it if you aren't careful


[10/5/2025 6:23 AM] deleteduser7329
ok how would that happen


[10/5/2025 6:23 AM] deleteduser7329
generally the game what do you mean


[10/5/2025 6:24 AM] deleteduser7329
previs is just fps and precombines right


[10/5/2025 6:27 AM] ursorenda
previs and precombines are similar but different. at the same time, they are connected. Scrap everything makes a lot of precombines scrapable. As a prominent example, you can scrap the *entire* red rocket station

This is a precombine. It is also a marker for previs. This would make the game kind of bug out when processing *which* previs items to show and make things pop in and out of existence. ooooonly they will still exist. You just won't be able to see them. So like invisible objects blocking your way. 

It can also create what's called save bloat. basically put, your save file becomes corrupted and will cause regular unfounded crashes to desktop.


[10/5/2025 6:28 AM] ursorenda
delayed and undelayed chaos. Scrapping rubble is fine, don't scrap things like roads or buildings

pring cleaning is no longer suported


[10/5/2025 6:41 AM] ursorenda
that's a limitation of vanilla survival mode, skirting it isn't save safe. 

Use the backslash command to bring up the ESP explorer, give yourself some save cigarettes or survival packs (auto saves and hard saves, respectively)


[10/5/2025 6:41 AM] deleteduser7329
it can mess the saves up


[10/5/2025 6:42 AM] ursorenda
yes that's why we don't allow unlimited survival mode to re-allow saving

Hey everyone. Curious to try out Anomaly, and I thought I'd check in here before I get started! 

Mainly interested in hearing how everyone approaches their playthrough, do you generally get started and follow the main quest lines, or branch away from the story? 

I'm interested in doing a playthrough where I'm less focused on the msq, and more on the survival/simulation aspects, and wondering if anyone else approaches Anomaly with this mindset, or if it's a good fit for this kind of playthrough.

Thanks, I look forward to hearing back.

For anyone having issues jumping or attaching wires in workshop -- a solution/workaround is going to: the pause screen/settings/gameplay and turning on controller support. Both functions work when using controller support rather than keyboard. 
You may need to go to the Mod Manager and activate the optional controller support mod though. I did that before starting the game, so the settings for controller support may not be there inherently


[10/5/2025 5:13 PM] boogeyymann

Dont get hit /j


[10/5/2025 5:30 PM] mynt_the_derg
bullets are deadly


[10/5/2025 5:31 PM] mynt_the_derg
You'll survive limb shots, typically but it can disarm you. w/o armor


[10/5/2025 5:32 PM] mynt_the_derg
w/o Armor, torso and headshots are leathal


[10/5/2025 5:34 PM] rafaelxr3
Does armor actually do anything? Because even with 60 armor points and wearing plate, any shot to the torso is a one-hit kill, regardless of the weapon


[10/5/2025 5:35 PM] rafaelxr3
And what's the point of having to rely on enemy RNG just to avoid being instantly killed by their first attack


[10/5/2025 5:35 PM] mynt_the_derg

[10/5/2025 5:36 PM] mynt_the_derg

enemies are both zone leveled and highly varied through a number of mods. You're probably picking a bad fight, if I'm being honest with you


[10/5/2025 5:40 PM] ursorenda
this mod pack puts more emphasis on strategic approach, to include "probably not worth fighting, I'll go around"


[10/5/2025 5:40 PM] mynt_the_derg
Me seeing super mutants anywhere


[10/5/2025 5:41 PM] ursorenda
if *all* enemies are one shotting you, you're either not in a good zone for your level/gear *or* you didn't set the MCM preset *or* you have something going on with your deployment that's messing with True Damage


[10/5/2025 5:42 PM] ursorenda
things are balanced to be a lot like real life. Plates will stop 1, *maybe* 2 bullets. After that your life is seriously threatened


[10/5/2025 5:42 PM] ursorenda
same with armor


[10/5/2025 5:42 PM] mynt_the_derg

is it possible to have other mod lists like wasteland genesis installed with anomaly


[10/5/2025 7:02 PM] ursorenda
possible for many mods but largely unrecommended


[10/5/2025 7:03 PM] ursorenda
settlement mods are generally fine, so are added weapons and armors. Anything else I would advise caution if you don't understand what you're trying to integrate and how it may affect existing systems.

[10/5/2025 7:38 PM] ursorenda
regardless of what the mod page for an added mod says you would place it at the very bottom of the load order, in other words don't move it at all. *maybe* move it around between other added mods, but for intents and purposes this mod pack is *the first thing that should be loaded above everything else*

[10/5/2025 9:36 PM] ursorenda
you can craft an item called cleansing tonic and it should also clear it


[10/5/2025 9:36 PM] ursorenda
you know the RADboy periodically announces your IRA, right?


[10/5/2025 9:37 PM] ursorenda
like audibly?


[10/5/2025 9:37 PM] mynt_the_derg
yeah should still check :)


[10/5/2025 9:37 PM] ursorenda
I can't tell if that means you fixed your issue :p


[10/5/2025 9:37 PM] ursorenda
but I'll ask you once more, if there's an issue with a mod not showing.... please make a support ticket


[10/5/2025 9:42 PM] deleteduser7329

[10/5/2025 9:43 PM] jekyll_

[10/5/2025 9:52 PM] mynt_the_derg

[10/5/2025 9:56 PM] ursorenda
you can cheese it with the ESP explorer, hit backslash (key under backspace) a couple times and then R to search


[10/5/2025 9:56 PM] ursorenda

[10/6/2025 3:45 AM] deleteduser7329
so i wonder why this mod downloads a forest but does not use it


[10/6/2025 3:55 AM] keplarion
May have had a problem downloading the mods? I’ve got a forest all around me when I go out.


[10/6/2025 3:56 AM] deleteduser7329
it uses a pine forest redone


[10/6/2025 3:56 AM] deleteduser7329
but not {a forest 0.8}


[10/6/2025 3:56 AM] deleteduser7329

[10/6/2025 3:57 AM] deleteduser7329
i just thought it was wqeird


[10/6/2025 4:10 AM] quizzling
Might be a left over download


[10/6/2025 4:12 AM] yami_ger
Could be also that soem assets of said mod are used in the oatches the team made

[10/6/2025 4:35 AM] murdock45
so i have a modding question. lets say i have replaced all weapons using the modern weapon replacer mod but ive also installed combined arms which adds the weapons to the leveled list. Will combined arms still distrubute the weapons into the LL or will i only ever see the weapons from MWR.


[10/6/2025 6:23 AM] toastonrye
Yae - you are exceptional is the skill perk overhaul mod


[10/6/2025 8:38 AM] jonhyboy47
Im still wandering how to defeat that monster from InTheFlesh quest. Turns out it's hard as F**k. 50 caliber and grenades does nothing.


[10/6/2025 8:39 AM] jonhyboy47
Did anyone tried this quest yet?


[10/6/2025 9:12 AM] vivi_vicious
is it me, or are a ton of revolver style weapons not being affected by revolver perks? 410. isn't getting the 30% damage boost from cowpoke...


[10/6/2025 9:26 AM] vivi_vicious
they are affected by handgun perks though


[10/6/2025 9:36 AM] nekonyancer
yae requires patching for revolvers in particular mostly bc theyre handled under a blanket pistol tag in base fo4


[10/6/2025 9:36 AM] nekonyancer
you can patch them yourself if you dont mind a lil fo4edit


[10/6/2025 9:37 AM] nekonyancer
yae has keywords for each gun type specifically to make compatibility edits easier and its like 1 edit per gun you wanna do


[10/6/2025 9:40 AM] nekonyancer
should be like.. yaecompatibilitykeyword_revolver iirc


[10/6/2025 10:45 AM] toastonrye
Can I change the butchering key? It's binded to F by default so instead of quick looting corpses it brings up the butcher/harvest menu first.

That is fine


[10/6/2025 12:45 PM] toastonrye
I notice in the hotkey manager some keys are set to shift+f5. However I can't seem to set shift+anything, is there a text file I need to edit out of game?

For reference one mag holds 100 rounds... and chews through ammo


[10/6/2025 2:08 PM] jonhyboy47
Why acid? Is it personal prefence or maybe more underrated ammo?

That’s setup like that because if your issue is related to the installation all relevant issues are answered in the install guide

Or at least it should be, let me know if it isnt


[10/6/2025 4:54 PM] ursorenda
I can tell from the snippit of a screenshot that you’re getting a download error. Click show archives. Use google for the enb, there’s a drive link for the hud file.


[10/6/2025 4:55 PM] patrickvin
yeah its the vault tect dlc file it cant find


[10/6/2025 4:55 PM] patrickvin
trying to fix it


[10/6/2025 4:56 PM] ursorenda
If it’s having an issue with the installation step then you’ll just have to try it again later. There are not any actionable solutions, it’s just wabbajack downloading a bad checkfile.


[10/6/2025 4:56 PM] patrickvin
ah okay. imma try verifying and such. otherwise ill wait then


[10/6/2025 4:57 PM] ursorenda
It would be more verifying that you followed the prerequisite steps in the installation guide. The only thing that would actionably prevent the installation step is not following those instructions


[10/6/2025 4:59 PM] patrickvin
asuming the video tutoprial is still up todate i should have. but if not and im stupid ill just do the install again. dosnt hurt to do


[10/6/2025 4:59 PM] ursorenda
It is not


[10/6/2025 4:59 PM] ursorenda
It covers 90% of things accurately


[10/6/2025 5:00 PM] patrickvin

[10/6/2025 5:04 PM] jonhyboy47
@The Sovereign is quests your kinda of problem solving? "In The Flesh Horror Quest" there are things to recheck...Im finding issues while at it.


[10/6/2025 5:06 PM] jonhyboy47
Already made a ticket...there are more issues besides the ones mention in support ticket. Just letting you know.


[10/6/2025 5:06 PM] nekonyancer
it seems to be something with enbseries fwik btw


[10/6/2025 5:07 PM] nekonyancer
ive seen two things that made me think of what the issue could be and its like, the link sends you to a bot trapping page and one of the links for fallout 4 on the site is dead rn


[10/6/2025 5:08 PM] ursorenda
try not to tag me unless it's urgent, my friend. I know I asked you to tag me for the riot armor thing but moving forward use the reply function :p 

I would make a support ticket for whatever you find, I'm more of a "project manager" in the mix of things and will direct developer efforts to look into things as I work through them


[10/6/2025 5:09 PM] nekonyancer
but yeah just manually downloading the zip and dropping it in the download folder works


[10/6/2025 5:09 PM] nekonyancer
so shrug


[10/6/2025 5:10 PM] ursorenda
yeah I need to take a look at that, Borris has all kinds of drama with the nexus devs


[10/6/2025 5:11 PM] toastonrye
How can I increase the saves count? It seems to only keep a few saves instead of just making new ones.

Oh. Sorry man...Yeah you said that and I forgot about it. Well alright....thanks anyway


[10/6/2025 5:11 PM] ursorenda
thats because cigarettes give auto saves. Craft survival packs to make "hard" saves that persist

oh, even sleeping?

sometimes. other times it does not. We can't stress enough how nebulous and random that issue is

sleeping commits auto saves.


[10/6/2025 5:40 PM] ursorenda
if you're using a controller then reset the keybinds to default. 

If you are using keyboard and mouse, create a support ticket.


[10/6/2025 5:56 PM] deleteduser7329
so if one wanted to spawn a poer armor is that posible

is it becouse im still in vault 111 and have not left yet

Psure you cant uh, use Power armor right off the bat.


[10/6/2025 6:50 PM] ursorenda
it's because we disable the use of power armor without progressing far enough to find someone to teach you


[10/6/2025 6:50 PM] ursorenda
we will not be removing that feature, nor providing workarounds 🙂


[10/6/2025 6:50 PM] ursorenda

[10/6/2025 7:29 PM] ursorenda
It’s been a feature for a few release versions now


[10/6/2025 7:30 PM] ursorenda
Just create a new install directory, that would accomplish what you’re requesting


[10/6/2025 7:31 PM] nomad5157
What's in annoucements will come with 0.6 so it will address your lore concerns


[10/6/2025 7:32 PM] deleteduser7329
of corse if you pl,ay as nora it does not make sence for you to use power armor


[10/6/2025 7:32 PM] deleteduser7329
right of the bat

No reason you can't play now lol you'll survive without power armor

There are a number of npcs, all of them make sense contextually


[10/6/2025 7:45 PM] deleteduser7329
there is a reason i kind of wanted to be able to do this i know my mod for Elizabeth from BioShock was breaking aft at the start i still cant open the aft hollo tape but i get an aft message when i get to sanctuary if i don't have companion mods  active so i was kind of trying to get to keep dog meat and get to piper real fast to see if i can still have more than one companion active at once with aft i cant turn god mode one and it would take me like 4 hours to fight my way there normally


[10/6/2025 7:46 PM] deleteduser7329
aft says the defuelt is 5 companions but i wanted to know if it worked because if that worked i was going to add transfer settlements and then make Shure i did not break anything


[10/6/2025 7:48 PM] toastonrye
it sounds like a fairly custom mod list you are working on...


[10/6/2025 7:49 PM] deleteduser7329
my reguler fallout  i did have a custom list the next gen broke like 30% of it


[10/6/2025 8:39 PM] deleteduser7329
so i did not know i could just take a tranfer setlemts blue print and convert it to a wsfw esl...

[10/6/2025 11:07 PM] quizzling
You can, just need to set new folder when you download from wabba


[10/6/2025 11:35 PM] fearhubert
I got a workaround for it. Not necessarily a fix but it works:


[10/6/2025 11:36 PM] fearhubert
For anyone having issues jumping or attaching wires in workshop -- a solution/workaround is going to: the pause screen/settings/gameplay and turning on controller support. Both functions work when using controller support rather than keyboard. 
You may need to go to the Mod Manager and activate the optional controller support mod though. I did that before starting the game, so the settings for controller support may not be there inherently


[10/7/2025 3:18 AM] reaper83171
thanks

does anyone else mp7 do 4 base damage?


[10/7/2025 12:04 PM] jimbiscus
yooo. I'm back after a long hiatus, how stable is the release atm ?


[10/7/2025 12:22 PM] ursorenda
first warning, don't double (or triple) ask again. I try to answer everyone, just be patient next time


[10/7/2025 12:24 PM] ursorenda
TGM is disabled for stability reasons, it has nothing to do with companions.


[10/7/2025 12:25 PM] ursorenda
the MP7 is broken atm, to be fixed in next release


[10/7/2025 12:25 PM] ursorenda
works a treat if I'm being honest. There are still some bugs but we're ironing them out as we go


[10/7/2025 12:27 PM] jimbiscus
that's great. time to reinstall !


[10/7/2025 12:27 PM] jimbiscus
last time I played was in may 2024


[10/7/2025 12:27 PM] ursorenda
it'll be wildly different


[10/7/2025 12:27 PM] ursorenda
but in a lot of ways the same :p


[10/7/2025 12:30 PM] jimbiscus
I bet ! had a really good time previously, fallout 4 is really one of the perfect blueprints for a survival shooter


[10/7/2025 12:41 PM] jimbiscus
sorry one last question, what kind of disk space do I need ? got 123 gigs free rn, is it enough for download + install ?


[10/7/2025 12:43 PM] ursorenda
needs IIRC 178 I would free up at least 250 gb if you're runnng an SSD to avoid chug and to establish the space for a pagefile if you haven't already set one


[10/7/2025 12:49 PM] jimbiscus
ye already got a big big pagefile

love the new starting area but i cant help but be sad that nora wont give me the reassurance i need to give the best speech im capable of /j


[10/7/2025 1:09 PM] ursorenda
should be in your AID category under devices, checking myself one sec


[10/7/2025 1:09 PM] toastonrye
All good, I must not get it until outside of the vault. In the vault I couldn't see it, but I have it in sanctuary now


[10/7/2025 1:10 PM] ursorenda
weird


[10/7/2025 1:16 PM] blastbeats
i'd just got the controller issue sorted i think, then steam gets ddosed


[10/7/2025 1:16 PM] mkdevst8r
Will the new update require a fresh playthrough? I may take a break if so


[10/7/2025 1:17 PM] blastbeats
can't even launch games now


[10/7/2025 1:18 PM] ursorenda
previously i was leaning towards yes, but at present looking closer to no. We can't know until we're close enough to set a relase date


[10/7/2025 1:18 PM] ursorenda
did you try the solution sausage posted?


[10/7/2025 1:18 PM] ursorenda
I don't see the issue you're describing?

Pick your fights carefully.


[10/7/2025 1:26 PM] ursorenda
Gear up, use your environment, grenades are OP as fuck (and there are two in the mail box just before you cross the sanctuary bridge), and running away is a *very* viable option especially early on

I really need to level demolitions so I can reduce Grenade damage taken


[10/7/2025 1:27 PM] ursorenda
If you're struggling I would recommend rolling a new character and trying the big game hunter background since it gives you a scoped .308 rifle


[10/7/2025 1:27 PM] ursorenda
if you wanna cheese, it randomizes attachements so you *can* roll a BGH background with a *silenced* scoped .308 rifle


[10/7/2025 1:27 PM] mynt_the_derg
Silenced Kimber Pistol works pretty well, and iirc the suppressor can be acquired pretty early


[10/7/2025 1:27 PM] ursorenda
yup


[10/7/2025 1:28 PM] ursorenda
plus it looks badass with the 35 degree resting position

Hey, anyone here remember that old anomalies mod that was considered for the list like a year or 2 ago before it fell off the map? I actually got a hold of the author, he's doing darktide modding now, and since the teams moving to do their own, y'all might be able to get something out of his mod, if y'all wanna reach out to him. Not sure what chat to throw this up in, so gen chat it goes

[10/7/2025 2:00 PM] cozycaco5784
If y'all want, I can kick the team his username so y'all can reach out. I do have his GitHub for the file, GitHubs are public and fine to be shared right?


[10/7/2025 2:01 PM] ursorenda
I would hold off until Nomad chimes in, it would be his decision (considering we're looking at making our own)


[10/7/2025 2:01 PM] ursorenda
In the MCM. If it's not under Gameplay it's under combat


[10/7/2025 2:03 PM] dio2075
is lone wanderer still in the game?


[10/7/2025 2:04 PM] cozycaco5784
My initial plan was to dm him, but his dms are private, so I can here. Feel free to ping or dm if y'all need any info


[10/7/2025 2:04 PM] _sks_sleezus
its in [Esc]>Mod Config>-=Fallout Anomaly Settings Manager=-


[10/7/2025 2:04 PM] _sks_sleezus
im a lil slow and thought that was a header for all the config files


[10/7/2025 2:08 PM] dio2075

Anyone got any tips on how to rebind the skin/harvest key to not f? makes looting impossible when you've got a knife on you


[10/7/2025 2:24 PM] ursorenda
that's vanilla behavior I'm not sure what you mean


[10/7/2025 2:25 PM] ursorenda
it's in the MCM under the survival category


[10/7/2025 2:25 PM] ursorenda
Yup I let him know.

[10/7/2025 2:29 PM] jonhyboy47
In my experience I believe vanilla configuration leaves an issue with human bodies...that menu was always poping up. Had to reconfigure. It was anoying...


[10/7/2025 2:30 PM] jonhyboy47
Those were not supose to do that I think....


[10/7/2025 2:30 PM] ursorenda
you're thinking of hunters of the commonwealth, yes? That's the "harvest humans" options


[10/7/2025 2:30 PM] ursorenda
well


[10/7/2025 2:30 PM] ursorenda
"harvest everything"


[10/7/2025 2:33 PM] jonhyboy47

They are already reworked, but we are currently building our own combat AI workflow

I can say categorically that sin settlements is not included

you can save with cigarettes. There are more than enough of those out in the wild that you should not need that

some people do have cosmically bad luck finding them at first. The appearance (but not the reality) is that they can't find *any*

Till they do, then they have no issue. It's the same psychological mechanism that causes you to see BMW's everywhere shortly after purchasing a BMW


[10/7/2025 8:17 PM] ursorenda
it's called preference bias :p

I noticed after making a new character in 0.5.7.9 that the butcher key F from hunters of the commonwealth doesn't seem to work until first death/reload. And there seemed like there was another thing that didn't work properly until my death/reload.

how do you get crafting journals?


[10/7/2025 10:57 PM] ursorenda
with *JESUS*


[10/7/2025 10:57 PM] ursorenda
it's an ECO thing, you have to make an "engineering bench" to make another bench


[10/7/2025 10:57 PM] ursorenda
so you can make craftign journals


[10/7/2025 10:58 PM] ursorenda
go into the MCM and adjust the settings of ECO so you don't have to do all of that


[10/7/2025 10:58 PM] boogeyymann
i was jw how to get them i crafted the engineering bench but cant seem to find any crafting journals or find them to buy


[10/7/2025 10:59 PM] ursorenda
yeah there's another bench you have to craft, should be one of the first in that menu


[10/7/2025 10:59 PM] ursorenda
it's a bit absurd


[10/7/2025 10:59 PM] ursorenda
as a project manager for this modpack, I would officially recommend skirting the requirement


[10/7/2025 11:00 PM] ursorenda
if you'd like to stick to the  ECO guns, you absolutely can. it's just gonna cost a large amount of caps and a few overdue library books


[10/7/2025 11:10 PM] mynt_the_derg
Eco is just Crafting within table within table within table

[10/7/2025 11:48 PM] ursorenda
"it's your modpack, why are you so blazey about it being included?"


[10/8/2025 12:36 AM] mynt_the_derg
I at first wondered why you had such a adverse reaction to it, but after dealing with it... yeah I understand now


[10/8/2025 1:38 AM] kagewune
Is there an overview of stuff like hud toggles? My game started without health bars and half way thru my playthrough i accidently enabled them but I kinda like not having them.


[10/8/2025 1:58 AM] ursorenda
what you saw was almost definitely a result of the  Immersive UI system.

It's a *very* old system. I won't tell you that it's going to categorically hide the UI the way you want. It's intended to, but it might not. 

Start by using F2 to *cycle* the UI elements.


[10/8/2025 1:58 AM] ursorenda
if it doesn't do what you would like it to, try adjusting the FallUI mod in the MCM


[10/8/2025 1:58 AM] ursorenda
if you still can't accomplish what you'd like, please create a support ticket

https://discord.com/channels/1113971680419782666/1406805530504331315 if you look to the pinned comments in that channel and create a ticket, I will find the time to help you


[10/8/2025 2:02 AM] ursorenda
to be frank, we will be replacing the UI mods soon lol


[10/8/2025 2:02 AM] ursorenda
I'm tired of directing my media team to use the TM command


[10/8/2025 2:03 AM] ursorenda

Ty for the help, whats the tm command?


[10/8/2025 2:58 AM] kagewune
And you mean i'm just good to put it under the bug reports ticket thingy?


[10/8/2025 3:14 AM] ursorenda
there  is a Fillout link for bug reports


[10/8/2025 3:14 AM] ursorenda
that is the console command for UI-free recording


[10/8/2025 3:15 AM] kagewune
ah cool didn't think it was a bug ty

[10/8/2025 3:33 AM] deleteduser7329
so can i craft purified water


[10/8/2025 3:35 AM] deleteduser7329
or the clensing tonic you talked about the other day


[10/8/2025 3:37 AM] ursorenda
Settlement building and the crafting that results is not something we have spent any reasonable amount of time considering. My understanding is that purified water can only be accomplished through 3rd party mods. we have not spent any time exploring that specific aspect.


[10/8/2025 3:37 AM] ursorenda
please, share what you see in the general chat


[10/8/2025 3:38 AM] ursorenda
our focus is about 15 stages removed from settlement building or crafting, so it would be helpful to say the least 🙂


[10/8/2025 3:38 AM] deleteduser7329
i have a recipe to craft dirty water from purified...but no way to go back


[10/8/2025 3:39 AM] ursorenda
I remember you mentioning this


[10/8/2025 3:39 AM] ursorenda
Make a support ticket, include a screenshot of that recipe


[10/8/2025 3:39 AM] ursorenda
we'll correct off of that 🙂


[10/8/2025 3:40 AM] deleteduser7329
ok


[10/8/2025 3:42 AM] ursorenda
it may not seem like it.... but our dev team is aware of the myriad of issues stable has. 

creating support tickets in the https://discord.com/channels/1113971680419782666/1406805530504331315 in the same way @jonhyboy47 has helps us immensely.

Filling out that form helps us keep track of issues, and furthermore helps us keep track of which of our community reports bugs often enough to deserve the elevated roles 🙂


[10/8/2025 3:43 AM] deleteduser7329
ok i will send them when i see them


[10/8/2025 3:43 AM] ursorenda

i will make shure i reproduce it in my unmodified modlist folder though first


[10/8/2025 3:44 AM] ursorenda
you don't have to go that far unless you'd like to a beta tester


[10/8/2025 3:45 AM] ursorenda
just be honest when you fill out the form about which mods you've added


[10/8/2025 3:45 AM] deleteduser7329
well i dont want to send a support ticket if its somthing i have done


[10/8/2025 3:45 AM] ursorenda
and remember:

the 0.6.0 launcher will tell on you regardless >:)


[10/8/2025 3:46 AM] ursorenda
lol


[10/8/2025 3:47 AM] ursorenda
I feel like that seemed like a heavy handed press


[10/8/2025 3:47 AM] ursorenda
I meant to say that the launcher will integrate into the installation process


[10/8/2025 3:47 AM] deleteduser7329
oh i got the old modern armors to work with this mod i removed the SubGraphData_HumanRaceSubGraphData from the old modern armors and now its using the file from ITO


[10/8/2025 3:47 AM] ursorenda
it will know if you opt'd to add extra mods


[10/8/2025 3:48 AM] ursorenda
see like that!


[10/8/2025 3:48 AM] ursorenda
you mentioned it


[10/8/2025 3:48 AM] deleteduser7329
yeah but diferent game folders


[10/8/2025 3:48 AM] ursorenda
but *how* that is implicated into the deployment means a lot


[10/8/2025 3:48 AM] deleteduser7329
i run two diferent modlist folders


[10/8/2025 3:48 AM] ursorenda
at least when asking for support


[10/8/2025 3:48 AM] ursorenda
I understand


[10/8/2025 3:49 AM] ursorenda
at present


[10/8/2025 3:49 AM] ursorenda
we don't provide extra support


[10/8/2025 3:49 AM] ursorenda
but with the 0.6.0 launcher, we can reasonably do so


[10/8/2025 3:49 AM] ursorenda
it'll tell us *if* we can support any additions


[10/8/2025 3:50 AM] ursorenda
and track if we can include those additions into later itterations


[10/8/2025 5:01 AM] kagewune
Sorry, also, when you die, does it just straight reload your most recent save? I've noticed some enemies i've killed past a specific save point linger after i've died and auto-reloaded.


[10/8/2025 5:18 AM] l0rd_dusty_
Is there a guide for the mod at all? May just be blind and not seeing it


[10/8/2025 5:20 AM] l0rd_dusty_
Guide as in for the features it introduces


[10/8/2025 5:56 AM] i.am.lemons
heya im watching a video of this mod and it looks so amazing


[10/8/2025 6:05 AM] patrickvin
is there a way to play with all features. but with fast travel unlocked? saw a mod that allowed it i think but dosnt seem to work


[10/8/2025 6:15 AM] keplarion
Not sure but if you're already in survival you should just be able to put `enablefastTravel 1` into the console


[10/8/2025 6:16 AM] keplarion
It may only work for one fasttravel at a time from what I'm reading


[10/8/2025 6:16 AM] patrickvin
hm okay thanks ill try it.

@Jim I haven't seen a complete list, but the user interface in the guide has some info. https://fallout-anomaly.github.io/websitedev/pages/guide.html#step5

As well as in the MCM menu under user interface there is like a hotkey manager to see some key binds

We're almost there, Nomad. Now make Rads silent unless a Geiger counter is equipped in a new equip slot.


[10/8/2025 12:06 PM] yami_ger
and you only find the geiger counter schematic in a certain vault that was hidden deep below a school

R.I.P. Ghoul builds may as well get rid of the perks entirely 😂😂

We have something in mind for that dont worry


[10/8/2025 12:14 PM] mkdevst8r
I hope! The tissue damage already makes ghoul build very difficult. Permeant negative effects will make it damn near impossible


[10/8/2025 12:19 PM] jimbiscus
thank you toastonrye! another question, I've set my weapon as a tool for some reason (misclick), any way to disable that ? it always asks me if I want to butcher corpses now


[10/8/2025 12:29 PM] toastonrye
@Jim yea I ran into that as well, F seems to be the default action key instead of E, because Q/E is nice for uneducated shooter leaning... So I changed the hunters of the common wealth key bind to B instead of F for butchering/harvesting in MCM. It should be in the survival category of MCM


[10/8/2025 12:29 PM] vextin
I was being sarcastic but also... Maybe I wasn't being sarcastic.

[10/8/2025 1:59 PM] ursorenda
It has to do with the way the floor was constructed inside vault 111, the leaning causes the havok engine to think you've interacted with a source of "force" which is really just two teeny tiny sides of floor pieces. Jettisons you like a pinball hit with both flippers lol


[10/8/2025 1:59 PM] ursorenda

[10/8/2025 2:25 PM] sk1ntf1re
Wasnt the first time that happened, are enemies not scaled with the player level?


[10/8/2025 2:38 PM] nomad5157
Enemies do not scale to player. 

1. Headshots are lethal


[10/8/2025 2:39 PM] sk1ntf1re

[10/8/2025 2:40 PM] sk1ntf1re
Any way to reduce posibility of headshots, also do helmets help? I see they give different protection but not sure if its the case for headshots


[10/8/2025 3:31 PM] tomtombar
Hey does anyone know if they are fixing the melee damage scaling in 0.6?


[10/8/2025 3:56 PM] toastonrye
@skintfire from my limited experience so far, it seems fairly easy to level up to around 7 and stay out of the Concord fight. It allows you to assign skill points and perks, I prioritized toughness then weapon of choice damages. To me important perks are law enforcer for dealing with human enemies and  zombie hunter for ghouls. The perks require 30 skill points to medicine and scavenger.


[10/8/2025 5:55 PM] boogeyymann
anyone know how to fix this?

Sim settlements 2


[10/8/2025 6:51 PM] nomad5157
It's going to be a lot more intense than what is in the pack now but we will build it to be way more user friendly


[10/8/2025 6:51 PM] nomad5157
For example once you reach rad levels 800+ you are pretty much terminal and will die eventually. For now a doctor will be able to cure but for a very large # of caps


[10/8/2025 7:01 PM] drakodraconis
Do we have a rough estimate for the update though? I got that fallout itch


[10/8/2025 7:08 PM] nomad5157
TBA - Not this year

If you want to help us test and be part of the beta team you can consider applying

Making it user friendly sounds awesome. I made it to level 7 and diamond city before noticing I never put a gas mask filter in. Muscle failure and too poor to recieve rad treatments lol

Thoughts on adding a way to turn on nightvision, removing mininukes/fatman, adding the vanilla controls menu, and removing the ability to slide so people stop accidentally crashing their game

[10/8/2025 11:43 PM] mynt_the_derg
There is a way to turn on night vision, It's Called looking up the keybind in mcm when you get a westek tactical goggle


[10/8/2025 11:43 PM] mynt_the_derg
(Hacked goggles/visor are most likely what you'll find)

I’m running a 4070 super, page file size is big, and the game just feels sluggish. Something I can change? 1440 native resolution.


[10/9/2025 3:21 AM] tiburse
Morning, I got a few hours of sleep lol. You caught me after I had laid down for the night haha.


[10/9/2025 3:36 AM] lateralus9290
What can cause textures/object to no load properly? Basically the church in Concord was one giant block with low resolution (doorway was covered in a giant texture). Thicket excavation had the same issue. Didn't have it in previous versions and the only thing that I turned off was the shadow mod that was causing popin.


[10/9/2025 3:47 AM] yami_ger
:PepeLaugh:


[10/9/2025 4:27 AM] _sks_sleezus
seems raiders are immune to mini nukes unless the player fires them?


[10/9/2025 5:23 AM] yuno0
FO4 Shadow boost in performance section can cause some LOD bug with actor and texture try to deactivate it if its not already done :1734vaultboy:


[10/9/2025 5:28 AM] lateralus9290
I did deactivate it as it was causing the popin of objects/npcs. So my guess having it disabled is causing this issue instead


[10/9/2025 5:30 AM] yuno0
Did you add some mod to your modlist ? or its a clean one ?


[10/9/2025 5:34 AM] lateralus9290
clean, but I did disable the 120 fps mod, as I'm playing with 60 anyway. But that did not have any impact before. Really, the only difference between now and previous version is the shadow boost


[10/9/2025 5:58 AM] yuno0
Did you try to set to 0 UsePreCulledObjects ? I notice some bug texture and flickering when its on so its can maybe help you but, take into account that by disabling this setting your fps will go down in some scenarios


[10/9/2025 6:07 AM] lateralus9290
Will try that, although there may be something wrong with those locations. I mean the thicket I can guess, since it has a lot of trees and a large pool of water. But why in the world did just the church in concord get affected, no other structure was like that. I also didn't have this in boston which should be the more performance heavy areas.


[10/9/2025 6:39 AM] xajirobe
Hi, I know that probably multiple people already did ask that, but I couldn't find a straight anwser. I got into anomaly just yesterday and I tried to do the cordon part with the power armor - I saw that you could use it and than it would self destruct, but it tells me whenever I try to move in it, that I need to find someone to teach me how to use it... Is it normal, or did I miss sth? Can someone please explain it to me?


[10/9/2025 6:42 AM] yami_ger
You need to learn pa traing via certain teacher they are spread over the world while one is only avaible after kellog which is also i think the only free one


[10/9/2025 6:43 AM] xajirobe
So essentialy the whole part with cordon I should do after I get some good gear, since pa is not available?


[10/9/2025 6:44 AM] yami_ger
I mean you can wven do it without ps just snipe and use maybe ordnanc eif you can or ghouls nearby

Wabba would throw an error if it got hung up. It doesn’t like errors of any kind lol


[10/9/2025 7:38 AM] toastonrye
I didn't find I needed the Power Armour for Concord. Cross the vertibird to the church and go down the stairs. The raiders destroy the deathclaw. I was able to sneak around, despite putting no points into sneak.


[10/9/2025 7:46 AM] riflepoet
also, do I still need to pick up the pip boy BEFORE I run the MCM presets?


[10/9/2025 7:47 AM] nomad5157

Until you got the right mod active number in mo2 :TI_nrv:


[10/9/2025 10:30 AM] toastonrye
I'm pretty sure there were status bars on Wabbajack. First is downloading, make sure you are logged into Nexus. Then is installing, it'll say complete when finished.


[10/9/2025 12:23 PM] riflepoet
yeah, it said completed but failed to launch


[10/9/2025 12:23 PM] riflepoet
I re-ran Wabba, twice and it finally launched


[10/9/2025 12:24 PM] riflepoet
so do I apply the MCM before or after I find the pip boy?


[10/9/2025 12:27 PM] yuno0
Just after you got it


[10/9/2025 12:35 PM] riflepoet
when I exit the vault?


[10/9/2025 12:35 PM] mynt_the_derg
when you Pick up the pipboy.

how do I equip stuff without a pipboy?

same as vanilla you cant.


[10/9/2025 12:39 PM] mynt_the_derg
pipboy's earlier on in the vault.


[10/9/2025 12:40 PM] toastonrye
There is a massive blue pop up that says to apply MCM after picking up the pipboy. Not trying to be rude but it's a lot easier to read the instructions first.. at least I did


[10/9/2025 12:41 PM] toastonrye
Because just in general, there is a lot of reading required in game to figure out negative stats and how to heal, etc


[10/9/2025 12:42 PM] mynt_the_derg
Maim goes brrrt


[10/9/2025 12:42 PM] toastonrye
Maim is definitely a struggle for me lol


[10/9/2025 12:43 PM] mynt_the_derg
Best thing I can say is, it's Helluva lot easier than Ace 3 for Arma.


[10/9/2025 12:47 PM] toastonrye
I find it difficult to decide when to heal, starting out you don't really know when you'll replenish your aid stuff.


[10/9/2025 12:47 PM] mynt_the_derg
healing mid combat is tough, and Unless you can escape or hide, you're most likely not going to get much healing

[10/9/2025 8:27 PM] nomad5157
Growing pains lol. You can change the hunting keybind in the mcm if you didn’t figure it out yet so you don’t keep opening that menu. I’ve only seen the first video so far. Will hopefully have another update out this weekend to fix/tweak things. Btw the reason you didn’t see the background menu at first in the start of your video was because that’s exactly why the mcm needs to be applied after picking up the pop boy. If you do it before it will cause that menu to not show.


[10/9/2025 8:29 PM] toastonrye
Nice, yea I ended up changing the keybind to B, seems to work okay. Slowly learning all the new keybinds from various mods


[10/9/2025 8:32 PM] nomad5157
There’s a hotkey manager in the mcm menu that has all of them and on the guide there’s a keybind menu on step 5. Thank you for showing the guide btw


[10/9/2025 8:39 PM] boogeyymann
place anywhere mod can be toggled right?

aaaaand crash when I went into workshop after repairing sanctuary house


[10/10/2025 9:48 AM] riflepoet
crashes consistently when I go into workshop 🙁


[10/10/2025 9:48 AM] riflepoet
but when I go up into a submenu to build


[10/10/2025 10:07 AM] riflepoet
!crash


[10/10/2025 10:11 AM] riflepoet
yep, workshop opens, as soon as I press UP to move up a menu, crash to desktop


[10/10/2025 10:11 AM] riflepoet
goes sideways ok..


[10/10/2025 10:11 AM] mkdevst8r
Can't help ya with that one brother. I have never repaired a sanctuary house. I'm sure the big boys will give you some directions at some point, maybe hold off on it for now


[10/10/2025 10:11 AM] mkdevst8r
It's a pretty stable build, I got to lvl 50 and have had almost 0 issues so


[10/10/2025 10:12 AM] riflepoet
can store things in it, can open weapons bench


[10/10/2025 10:12 AM] riflepoet
yeah... build seems amazing in general


[10/10/2025 10:12 AM] mkdevst8r
You can also check #🆘support-channel and see if there was a similar issue while you wait for the big bosses


[10/10/2025 10:13 AM] mkdevst8r
Or search the discord w keywords


[10/10/2025 10:14 AM] mkdevst8r
This probably isn't the issue but make sure you apply the MCM settings


[10/10/2025 10:14 AM] riflepoet
yes, MCM applied


[10/10/2025 10:14 AM] mkdevst8r
Reinstalling the fixed sanctuary mod(I don't know the name) could also potentially fix it


[10/10/2025 10:14 AM] riflepoet
ok, I had SHOW MOD hotkey set to UP


[10/10/2025 10:15 AM] riflepoet
restarted game asfter switching out that key to something random, now it works


[10/10/2025 10:15 AM] mkdevst8r
Good good good


[10/10/2025 10:16 AM] mkdevst8r
And yeah about the cigs to save. . they're pretty common tbh so you shouldn't have too much if an issue after clearing your first few raider camps


[10/10/2025 10:16 AM] mkdevst8r
I almost never ran out of cigs


[10/10/2025 10:16 AM] mkdevst8r
U can pres H to open the hotwelheel for easy access to your aid stuff


[10/10/2025 10:17 AM] mkdevst8r
G is VAFS and Z is vrit for VAFS that's not listed anywhere I was able to find and is probably helpful.


[10/10/2025 10:18 AM] mkdevst8r
West Tek goggles has its own MCM hotkey manager thing


[10/10/2025 10:18 AM] mkdevst8r
Other than that I think all the controls are more or less the same

hi sir. How to OG


[10/10/2025 12:35 PM] l0rd_dusty_
is tehre a way to see your radiation amount? or even if your currently being irradiated? the thing hadnt said anything or started ticking and didnt even know it was irradiating me until it said i got sickness


[10/10/2025 1:04 PM] toastonrye
I believe the rad boy device in your inventory aid section shows your ingested rads amount, but there is also the environment radiation, the green vertical bar on the left side of the screen.


[10/10/2025 1:06 PM] toastonrye
I played to level 7 not realizing my gas mask didn't have a filter on, so the radiation accumulated slowly but by that time it was too expensive to fix so I started a new character lol


[10/10/2025 1:18 PM] l0rd_dusty_
ended up figuring the radboy part out, now im stuck on try to figure out what uranium fever is and how to get rid of it, tried  a few things but i got no idea, is there a guide or something on effects in game or somewhere i missed? on the github "guide" and dont see anything about it


[10/10/2025 1:19 PM] toastonrye
It's hard to miss, but yes there is a guide. It's the green text on display in Wabbajack during the lengthy install process


[10/10/2025 1:19 PM] toastonrye
It's full of information


[10/10/2025 1:21 PM] toastonrye
https://fallout-anomaly.github.io/websitedev/pages/guide.html#step5


[10/10/2025 1:21 PM] toastonrye
The radiation mechanics I think...


[10/10/2025 1:25 PM] l0rd_dusty_
it definitely is, but at this point i might just start a new game, as i got so much and the injectors are barely depleting it, good thing i just started i guess


[10/10/2025 1:38 PM] l0rd_dusty_
off question but is there a way to raise specials? the character build generator seems to imply you can get high specials, but the site also says you only get 10 perks


[10/10/2025 1:57 PM] toastonrye
Not sure about that, haven't looked at the build gen.. besides leveling and putting points into specials, or bobble heads I don't know


[10/10/2025 2:16 PM] nomad5157
I’ll update the gen build later today. The full guide also opens up in your browser when you launch the game first time…so kinda hard to miss because you have to close your browser


[10/10/2025 3:21 PM] l0rd_dusty_
im assuming your referring to the github one? other than that i dont remember one popping up


[10/10/2025 4:15 PM] zzzsleepysheepzzz
Why when I use another another millennia a weapon pack shotguns they reload every single shell needed to fill the tube when I only shot one shell? Is bullet counted reload not patched for it? And the lever actions do the same thing.


[10/10/2025 4:16 PM] zzzsleepysheepzzz
Kinda makes them useless ya kno


[10/10/2025 5:00 PM] keplarion
Not sure if this is still an issue but a doctor should be able to clear all of that up for you. Most docs also sell potions that alleviate the effects of radiation poisoning


[10/10/2025 5:02 PM] l0rd_dusty_
Ya, I just remade a character as i was just at the beginning of the game so it didn't bother me too much other than a little annoyance


[10/10/2025 6:26 PM] nomac715
Hey, has anyone else have a window size issue or know a fix? The game window shows on the entire screen but the actual play window/HUD/interact/etc  is in a smaller size window up in the left hand corner. I have been trying to find a fix to match the sizes with no luck.

[10/10/2025 10:44 PM] jackson21a
Sorry if this is already asked question, but all ive done is eat cooked mole rat and killed some raiders and i have radiation poisoning is eating even cooked food that dangerous?


[10/10/2025 10:45 PM] jackson21a
And ive been avoiding rad and just cleaned myself


[10/10/2025 10:46 PM] ursorenda
The short answer is yes but likely your IRAs (checked with Radboy in AID inv) and total RADs (green bars on the bottom left) are high enough to get ead poisoning


[10/10/2025 10:46 PM] ursorenda
It’s intended to mimic the real world risks of exposure without being too over bearing, but if you weren’t already aware of the radiation mechanics  it can be a bit much 😅


[10/10/2025 10:51 PM] jackson21a
I was aware it just seems like it came out of nowhere. I turned off the hardcore weather because it was a bit much for me killed some raiders and ate and i suddenly had it.


[10/10/2025 10:51 PM] jackson21a
Hmm im on the second layout for the ui.


[10/10/2025 10:52 PM] jackson21a
How do i have the green bar show up for that?


[10/10/2025 10:52 PM] ursorenda
no clue, I've never expplored the seescond layout for the UI. To be honest, I wasn't aware there was one


[10/10/2025 10:52 PM] ursorenda
It should be above the compass on the bottom leftt


[10/10/2025 10:54 PM] ursorenda
Ascends vertically and breaks every I believe 50 points of RAD


[10/10/2025 10:56 PM] jackson21a
Hmm thanks for answering. So I had been keeping track of my rads with the device. Is it possible that I ignored the green bar sense I couldn’t see it and got poisoning.


[10/10/2025 10:58 PM] ursorenda
Yeah IRAs and RADs are unique to each other but tied into the same system. Too much of either will cause Rad poisoning *as well* will promote the accrual of the other. So a high IRA level will give you period RADs, a high RAD level will elevate your IRAs by a per second calculation relative to your total RADs


[10/10/2025 11:03 PM] jackson21a
Thank you very much for your help and one last question how do I make gunpowder? I know I can recycle ammo but is there a way to make it from materials?


[10/10/2025 11:05 PM] ursorenda
currently requires building an ECO bench, start witht he ENggineering bench and then research utility bench. This gives the resources needed to unlock and build ammo bench. 

We're removing that, it sucks lol


[10/10/2025 11:13 PM] jackson21a
Yeah I have the ammo bench unlocked but don’t see gunpowder?


[10/10/2025 11:13 PM] ursorenda
You'd have to look up ECO and what they did with it


[10/10/2025 11:14 PM] ursorenda
Changes made to crafting were before my time


[10/10/2025 11:23 PM] jackson21a
I figured it out it’s in crafting mastery 2 ammo crafting settings. Right there is an option for gunpowder to be craftable in hard mode.

Hi, i am planning to reinstalling the modlist on my fresh new pc but due to also being a dad soon reaching 40 i fear i might not be cut for survival mode anymore.

I remember that unlucky 7 mod is optional and can be disabled but is it there a way to make the modlist more "softcore friendly", like no carryweight penalty, no need for sleep/eat/drink and freedom of saving whenever (that one is essential when a kid is facing a diaper disaster irl)?

[10/11/2025 9:47 AM] tiburse
I mean you can edit most of the mods in game through MCM. Just keep in mind that doing so is much a "at your own risk" and not officially supported kind of deal. I have a tweaked version myself. Ill help you as I can with it if you have questions.

Bullet counted reload is busted. Not a single weapon that should be using it is working.

Lever-action rifles, and all shotguns require you to fill the entire magazine back up and it can't be interrupted.

You applied the MCMs at the start? If you are still an early level with not many points into handguns it could be normal... Early game I try to avoid combat invest my perk points into toughness then damage, you don't start off a super hero

Can someone help me, gas mask filters aren't degrading and hud isn't reflecting use,it just stays at 100%... on a previous save it was working but now, nothing.. didn't do anything different.. any suggestions?


[10/11/2025 11:56 AM] toastonrye
I was wondering that too, when I first came out of vault 111 it dropped to 95% and it's been consistently there. I'm not taking much environmental rad damage... that I've noticed anyways. I'm level 7 around Graygarden

[10/11/2025 12:37 PM] toastonrye

only thing I really care about is ammunition crafting lol. And maybe fancier lookin nvgs


[10/11/2025 7:36 PM] nomad5157
We have some big changees for ammo crafting. Going to make it fun and not just something you have to do but actually feel like a progressive reward system when you craft...think satisfactory very lite mode

How does the Grease Monkey perk actually work? i swear i have like 4 different types of wrenches and it still wont let me pull parts from a destroyed protectron


[10/11/2025 8:43 PM] penguinken
does anyone know how to make stims work instantly or how to spped it up on defalt mode, i tried a survival mod that was supposed to make healing instant but it didnt work...


[10/11/2025 9:06 PM] mkdevst8r
it has a really low chance it seems, if you get 1 grease monkey, and 1 massachusetts oil tycoon, you can get expanded engine-uity wich increase success rate by 15%, it also might be affected by salvage, engineering, and luck but im not sure


[10/11/2025 9:07 PM] mkdevst8r
also the robots might explode be careful lol


[10/11/2025 9:08 PM] yuuki_desu
hi im really sorry for asking question here, but Ive been stuck after installing everything right.
I finished all installation and followed swiftly
but whenever I open mod organizer, this pop-up appears

"The Application has failed to start because its side-by-side configuration is incorrect. Please see the application event log or use the command-line sxsstrace.exe tool for more detail."


[10/11/2025 9:10 PM] penguinken
how do i make stims work instantly or how to speed it up on default mode with survival mode, i tried a survival mod that was supposed to make healing instant but it didn't work...


[10/11/2025 9:10 PM] nomad5157
This is not something we support in anomaly. It's build that way on purpose


[10/11/2025 9:11 PM] nomad5157
You can try to do a reinstall. Have never seen that issue with mo2 before seems it's probably a system issue on your end


[10/11/2025 9:13 PM] yuuki_desu
lemme see


[10/11/2025 9:47 PM] yuuki_desu
oh it works now.


[10/11/2025 9:47 PM] yuuki_desu
Thnx!


[10/11/2025 10:16 PM] ursorenda
Make sure you create a support ticket if that doesn’t fix your issue

Hey I was curious how close is 0.6 exactly because im starting to get decently far into a save (Level 13) and was unsure if i should keep playing, or just wait

[10/12/2025 12:43 AM] nomad5157
Your issue is caused by something with your vanilla fallout 4 setup. Reverify in steam


[10/12/2025 12:53 AM] skadhwe
verifying didn't work trying fresh install now

Does companions have a Quick Inventory Hotkey?


[10/12/2025 7:30 AM] mkdevst8r
caDPTA doesnt remove many rads. only like 25 i think? it removes alot more IRA than it does rads. if youre early in i really recomend || finding heather as a quick and easy source of those kinds of meds ||


[10/12/2025 8:36 AM] jonhyboy47
Place everywhere is already in OPTIONALS section and is disabled by default.


[10/12/2025 8:41 AM] jonhyboy47

[10/12/2025 8:42 AM] jonhyboy47
Since scrap everything or Place everywhere are almost identical in causing a mess...just bare that in mind.

[10/12/2025 10:12 AM] mkdevst8r
i picked up the backyard batteries perk - allows crafting of basic energy amunition at chem station... its not in the list of the chem station or the ammunition station, any idea?


[10/12/2025 10:16 AM] tiburse
you still need to get the schematic from the engineering bench


[10/12/2025 10:16 AM] mkdevst8r
so.... dead perk then?


[10/12/2025 10:16 AM] tiburse
I think it costs 100 of that ammo.


[10/12/2025 10:16 AM] tiburse
I honestly have not tested how that perk works in terms of if it is also needed.


[10/12/2025 10:17 AM] tiburse
Check the Ammunition workbench for it if you can


[10/12/2025 10:17 AM] mkdevst8r
yeah its not in electronics, ammunition, or chem bench


[10/12/2025 10:19 AM] mkdevst8r
after getting the schematics its now in the ammunition bench, but it does not require backyard batteries at all


[10/12/2025 10:20 AM] mkdevst8r
looks like a dead perk


[10/12/2025 10:21 AM] tiburse
copy that, can you make a support ticket on it so we can add it to the tracker and what not


[10/12/2025 10:22 AM] mkdevst8r
how do i do a support ticket? ive never really needed to tbh so im not sure


[10/12/2025 10:23 AM] tiburse
Fallout Anomaly Bug Report, under #🆘-access-rest-of-discord-here, at the bottom of the post


[10/12/2025 10:23 AM] mkdevst8r
thank you!


[10/12/2025 10:28 AM] tiburse
No problem!


[10/12/2025 10:36 AM] lateralus9290
Anyone has an idea what makes the PPM gasmask not appear on the player body all of a sudden?


[10/12/2025 10:45 AM] mkdevst8r
is there perhaps a command to give me a single background trait point? 

i took an ambrosia to refund myself the backyard battery perk, but i lost my background, loosing two perks in exchange for the dead one :c


[10/12/2025 10:46 AM] mkdevst8r
ima just load a 15 min old save tbh


[10/12/2025 10:55 AM] tiburse
thats probably the best idea there


[10/12/2025 10:55 AM] tiburse
I "think" there is a drug that lets you do it in the chem bench


[10/12/2025 10:55 AM] tiburse
I cant recall the name but I know its an SSRI lol


[10/12/2025 10:56 AM] mkdevst8r
yeah its called ambrosia, it doesnt work properly. i made a tiocket for that as well, it does everything except background traits. i think it has something to do with the MCM presets, probably the same reason ur supposed to apply preset after picking up the pipboy

i had to get that perk that doesnt trigger them. landmines are in the weirdest places lmao


[10/12/2025 11:26 AM] toastonrye
Does the gas mask filter go through frequent damage everywhere outside? My usage is still at 100% after spending a few hours in the Concord area. Not sure what normal is, maybe it only takes damage near obvious rad sources like barrels?


[10/12/2025 11:36 AM] tiburse
Heh I need to


[10/12/2025 11:59 AM] yuuki_desu
after dying for maybe around a 100 times, I was able to finally reach diamond city!

The main story quests are still there.


[10/12/2025 2:10 PM] lateralus9290
Maybe the 'wet' effect?


[10/12/2025 2:21 PM] maaxxpowwer

what's the hotkey for explosives?


[10/12/2025 2:39 PM] toastonrye
should be unchanged? Holding L-alt I think


[10/12/2025 2:39 PM] doc7070
it was the holding part of it that I didn't have


[10/12/2025 2:52 PM] nomad5157
Will be updated shortly on there.


[10/12/2025 2:52 PM] nomad5157
It is supposed to, but with that mod being updated there may be some underlining issues

how can I unlock the load order of gas masks, need to lower it because its not working, keeps staying at 100%... Mod page says to keep it low in load order to resolve issues but I cant lower it past FUCKASSDAPATCH. whenever I think I fixed it it freezes again...


[10/12/2025 3:15 PM] nomad5157
You will know if you have a filter on toast if you see the actual animation play.


[10/12/2025 3:16 PM] boogeyymann
So I finally found a water chip…. And I’ve slept like a week and it hasn’t made any purified water


[10/12/2025 3:17 PM] nomad5157
If I recall you have to assign a settler


[10/12/2025 3:17 PM] toastonrye
I'm just playing with the masks now. It seems like its working. If I change the radiation mode in the gas mask's MCM settings to normal, the filters degrade over time. However it's set to precipitation only in this mod list.


[10/12/2025 3:18 PM] toastonrye
which I think is a good balance, not losing filter integrity on sunny days


[10/12/2025 3:19 PM] nomad5157
Yeah they will only degrade if you're in an actual bad weather. Rain, rads etc etc


[10/12/2025 3:19 PM] penguinken
so are you not using the precipitation only?


[10/12/2025 3:20 PM] penguinken
ore is that is ow setting


[10/12/2025 3:20 PM] toastonrye
I plan on it yes. I was just curious why my gas mask filter was still 100%.. But it makes sense now that I realize I haven't been caught in any rain storms


[10/12/2025 3:21 PM] toastonrye
precip only should be the MCM presets for this modlist


[10/12/2025 3:21 PM] penguinken
okay


[10/12/2025 3:23 PM] penguinken
must be because of clear sky, we need some sort of hud to tell us when gas mask can be taken off because the color of gasmask doesnt seem to be notifying when its okay outside


[10/12/2025 3:24 PM] toastonrye
Even clear sky will kill you overtime. I bricked my first character doing that at level 7


[10/12/2025 3:24 PM] nomad5157
Well we did not make the mod so you would need to speak to the mod author. The gas mask does tell you when it's taking damage.


[10/12/2025 3:24 PM] toastonrye
I think it's only safe to take off masks indoors


[10/12/2025 3:25 PM] boogeyymann

are you talking just the water or blood droplets? shift+k wipes the mask off


[10/12/2025 3:44 PM] l0rd_dusty_
this is without the mask on and its not raining, went swimming for a couple seconds and now i have a constant watter drops on the screen, and no the wiping doesnt help ive done that multiple times already  D=

Try creating a new game and save to see if that one also fails to load. But I suspect something might be wrong with that save file (not an expert). Maybe create a support ticket with the save

I don't think you 'need' to, but it is recommended as sometimes existing mods will not be updated right.

Hey, really nice modlist, was stunned by the visual and the ||new looking ghoul in 111||, got hooked on immediately. Tho a lot info you need to dig yourself in this discord, as there are too many mods with features crucial to gameplay. I had one yet no answer found, where can I get a knife or blowtorch early for butchering? I'm at red rocket and all the corpses of molerat lying around and I'm starving to death. I read that you could use ',' to cheat it, but that would be my last resort, or I will headback to santury where I left the gourds gifted by ||the ghoul||.


[10/13/2025 8:48 AM] old_snayon
Is there a spot to ask for help? T key not working and neither is space bar for jumping...


[10/13/2025 8:49 AM] kregond

Hi, does someone know when I take the max level of Motion Sensors perk in Engineering. My robotic companions still missing a lot of times. But the perk actually says they can never miss ?


[10/13/2025 11:15 AM] hopadamaron
Does this modlist feature fallout?


[10/13/2025 11:16 AM] lateralus9290
I think this is an engine issue. Sometimes it even rains when in an internal cell.

I don't know if somebody brought it up before, but as of 5.8.0, mama murphey still undressed all her clothes after I met her at sanctuary, and when I talked to Preston, he wore musks, I just installed the modlist today, so noway it is not updated.

[10/13/2025 12:34 PM] kregond
Yeah I read the enitre guide page(fallout-anomaly.github.io), like which button do what which mods are there doing what, very nice guide. However, it just wasn't listed anywhere in that page about getting a knife to butcher, tho a lot info in is in this discord. Now I'm getting tortured by radiation sickness, the radaway is really weak compared to what radtion storm does to you. I forgot to change a filter for 5 secs and reached 5 slots of rads, and one radawy cures like one. Now I stumble my way to find the nearest doctor. Also concord is brutal.

[10/13/2025 1:38 PM] kregond
I went to the little broken store near vault 81 where in vanilla should be a dead merchant, there's a live one called niah, I'm level 7 and she sell m72 gauss rifle for 874 (also 2mm EC for 34), wth, I just cured my radition for 300 and heal my health for 150 at bethany. I think leveled list and price is kinda broken here? And she sell a trash 10mm for 2000 and stimpak for 300 caps(or military catridge in this modlist)


[10/13/2025 1:54 PM] kregond
ok so I bumped into cricket and she sell m72 for 874 as well and x12 plasmacaster for 384, something about those modded weapons went wrong, both their price and leveled list, bc they look like really late-game weapons (as their damage indicate). spray'n pray is 2800 at a normal price. most other modded weapons seem fine as well, kimber cutom pistol (10mm you receive as newbie weapon at 111) has ridiculous sell price of around 2000, their price is broken too. if someone else also confirm this, probably I should make a ticket?


[10/13/2025 2:28 PM] caymiss
yeah i'm on an older version, but the Kimber Custom has always sold for a pretty high price - not 2000 though


[10/13/2025 2:31 PM] kregond
2000 for buy price from the merchant so base price would be roughly 1000 and sell price 400-500 if you have no barter related perks. if in vanilla maximum is 1.2xbase buy price and 0.8xbase sell price, not exactly sure about the modlist here


[10/13/2025 3:10 PM] caymiss
the overall balance is being worked on, there's some things that stand out like that


[10/13/2025 3:11 PM] caymiss
for example the MK 12 does x2 the dmg that other 5.56 rifles do, effectively 1-shotting most enemies

Sorry I cant find anything for this on support. Im having trouble with wabbajack not locating fallout 4 to download. I played this pack earlier this year and with some of the new additions like seasons I wanted to jump back in

No. The game essentially froze. I couldn't do anything.

Yeah. Im reinstalling fallout and checking all the required add-ons


[10/13/2025 9:35 PM] nomad5157
Sometimes this is due to a vanilla bug if you're stuck in the anim. You can run in console Player.PushActorAway Player 0


[10/13/2025 9:46 PM] reversalshadow7540
It seems to be installing now. I must of been missing one of the add-ons

Have some small questions about perks, so I see a lot of perks require background perks but have them "=0" and those texts are not greened out, does that mean for now all background perks are no longer requirement for those perks? Also I see some perks in survival and medicine have some overlap with HOTC so they are kinda less worth taking? And all VATS perks are integrated into VAFS?

[10/14/2025 6:01 AM] killerqueen4
Don't have the game installed on an external hard drive, that causes major stability and performance issues


[10/14/2025 6:02 AM] killerqueen4
If youre worried about space, you can have the wabbajack downloads be on the external hard drive


[10/14/2025 6:33 AM] hopadamaron
I would say it’s probably cause they’re working on 0.6 atm

He gets healed by stimpacks so I think humanoid?


[10/14/2025 6:52 AM] hopadamaron
What have you done so far? Cause if I had that problem I’d probably get a fresh install of fallout 4, then reinstall anomaly


[10/14/2025 7:02 AM] nomad5157

The prompt should let you know to use stimpak hes treated as a synth so aka humanoid


[10/14/2025 7:10 AM] hopadamaron
And by fresh install of fallout 4 you deleted all the files manually and verified steam files right?

Going to be real. Most of the time I am 'online' is when I am at work IRL myself. It takes me 20-30 min to see things sometimes dependent on workload. I try to reply to everyone overnight (due to work schedule).

I have tried various other modpacks (to gain better understanding of how patching works) since joining the team here at FOA. By far I can say this team is far more responsive than anywhere else.  As well as, seeing that other modpacks are very much a "good luck"  scenario. Where stuff here actually gets fixed as long as you go through the proper instructions an support tickets.


[10/14/2025 7:39 AM] tiburse

Listen I did this and broke the devs of xedit for about 2 hours. Had them trying to figure out how I built my personal modlist (for learning dev things) by reverse engineering the stock folder made by wabbajack during install.


[10/14/2025 8:41 AM] tiburse
Ended up needing to repoint all the pathways of xedit as it does not work if you build it without wabba doing it.

I was defensive driving and fleet/convoy aware certified at one point. Was going to be doing sensitive delivery's for a redacted organization.

[10/14/2025 8:53 AM] tiburse
I also took that experience to drive stock cars on dirt tracks lol.


[10/14/2025 9:21 AM] lateralus9290
Are the anomaly fields going to be mandatory? I play GAMMA as well, so having to deal with anomalies there is enough for me 😄


[10/14/2025 9:22 AM] nomad5157
Yes it will be part of the core mod. They have their own sound/visual effects to help you avoid them


[10/14/2025 9:25 AM] lateralus9290
Do you plan to make them in 2 versions as in GAMMA? Static that has chance for artifact spawn and dynamic ones throughout the map that are just there to annoy you? 🙂
What about artifacts? Spawn after radstorm, or you've not got to that part in planning yet?


[10/14/2025 9:25 AM] nomad5157
The plan is to have some static and some dynamic - Artifacts are tba

[10/14/2025 9:27 AM] lateralus9290
Does the engine support detection of the anomalies via throwables, or will it be audio/visual only?


[10/14/2025 9:35 AM] nomad5157
Yes.

The detection mechanic relies on scripting, but it’s a simple chain reaction in the engine:

The Bolt: It acts as a standard projectile that has a unique identifier (a Magic Effect or Keyword) attached to it.

The Anomaly: It acts as a trigger box placed over the dangerous area and has a Papyrus script attached.

The Reaction: The script's job is to listen for a collision from any projectile. When a collision occurs, the script verifies the proj of the bolt and  the script spawns a visual reaction (VFX/sound) right at the bolt's exact location.

That's in simple terms but it can be more complex than that

You just update through wabbajack. It will tell you what version


[10/14/2025 11:14 AM] seanlegacy

Hey guys, sorry for bothering, I have installed modlist and started the game folder/mod org/launch fallout anomaly, make character and it is all ok until I press mcm and it crashes back to mod org


[10/14/2025 11:30 AM] nomad5157
It can take several seconds for the MCM to load. There are over 3000 values being loaded at the same time. If it is crashing please verify install and try again

I'm just trying to enable vats, but the hotkey for it doesn't work.. is there anything else I have to do?


[10/14/2025 11:41 AM] seanlegacy
question, have you tried the vats mod their using before?


[10/14/2025 11:42 AM] hellfiremode
I didn't see anything in the MO


[10/14/2025 11:43 AM] seanlegacy
reason i asked is because the one they use it replaces the way vats works.


[10/14/2025 11:44 AM] hopadamaron
Btw if you installed ur own mods, be sure to add [nodelete] at the beginning of its name so it stays in the modlist


[10/14/2025 12:09 PM] mynt_the_derg
I mean in the pack there's two methods of saving, Cigarrettes, and Survival packs. (autosaves, and hard saves)


[10/14/2025 12:10 PM] mynt_the_derg
Look for V.a.f.s. in MCM The Hotkey change + Vats change settings are there.


[10/14/2025 12:15 PM] hopadamaron
I know, but I kinda forget all the time and there are times when I have to log off because of my job


[10/14/2025 12:17 PM] mynt_the_derg
You *do* Get an exit save in survival.


[10/14/2025 12:18 PM] mynt_the_derg
It's just not one you can reload to at will, only on when you next play that save file


[10/14/2025 12:18 PM] stinky6764
I have verified base fallout 4 game and Anomaly and started the Anomaly. Crashed after 5ish seconds of loading in MCM... I made sure that I fallow install instructions.

[10/14/2025 1:06 PM] hellfiremode
Is there a specific hotkey change I need to set? I don't see one for vats in particular


[10/14/2025 1:07 PM] mynt_the_derg
Just go to the Vafs Tab in mcm. and Look at things :)


[10/14/2025 1:07 PM] mynt_the_derg
there's an option for the keybind, and to Just outright disable vafs


[10/14/2025 1:07 PM] hellfiremode
I will take a peek, I must be blind.


[10/14/2025 1:08 PM] mynt_the_derg
I dont remember what branch it's under either gameplay or combat.


[10/14/2025 1:26 PM] hellfiremode
I looked through it again, but I don't see anything relating to a VATS keybind, just Toggle focus for Vafs, the use critical for vafs, awareness, and vans.


[10/14/2025 1:31 PM] mynt_the_derg
Toggle focus is your keybind Vafs replaces Vats


[10/14/2025 1:31 PM] mynt_the_derg
There iirc is an option, to enable vanilla vats however as a debug


[10/14/2025 1:34 PM] hellfiremode
Yeah, I've tried that as well


[10/14/2025 1:34 PM] hellfiremode
No luck 🙁


[10/14/2025 1:37 PM] toastonrye
Have you tried playing with vafs? it seems disabling vats is a significant part of the mod lists design philosophy


[10/14/2025 1:37 PM] hellfiremode
It's not that I dislike vafs, it's that VATS is a core part of the experience for me


[10/14/2025 1:38 PM] hellfiremode
It doesn't really come down to balance or making things easy/hard, it's just very fun to me, even if I don't use it all the time


[10/14/2025 1:40 PM] toastonrye
I was just curious, what I really enjoy about modpacks is, someone else put in the hours to make the thing work. I just get to play lol


[10/14/2025 1:42 PM] hellfiremode
While you can play call of duty the whole game, it is nice to just throw some rpg style shots once in a while, and sometimes they hit, sometimes they dont, especially with flailing enemies


[10/14/2025 1:43 PM] hellfiremode
I played a NV modlist that similarly disabled vats, I re-enabled it with it being far less useful than bullet time, but I still enjoyed using it where I could


[10/14/2025 1:53 PM] mynt_the_derg
99% chance to hit, Point blank, still misses /j


[10/14/2025 1:54 PM] thracian8519_71863
Ok , can you point me in the direction to do so, also no im playing with keyboard and mouse cus the controller settings wont work properly. thank you


[10/14/2025 2:11 PM] hellfiremode
Well.. either way I can't figure it out for the life of me.. even though people here seem to, it just refuses to work. Very unfortunate


[10/14/2025 2:12 PM] hopadamaron
Quick question, is the kimber custom pistol inspired by the 1911a1? I see a lot of similarities


[10/14/2025 2:13 PM] hopadamaron
Nvm just looked it up, it’s a modern 1911

[10/14/2025 2:22 PM] mynt_the_derg
maim has a wheel?


[10/14/2025 2:24 PM] jimbiscus
it does, might be from another mod that is compatible with maim


[10/14/2025 2:24 PM] hellfiremode
Oh my god, I got it working somehow..


[10/14/2025 2:25 PM] mynt_the_derg

Is North Boston Police Station locked behind a quest or something? I can't seem to find a way inside.

press H to open wheel menu, can be rebound in Mod Config -> User Interface -> Wheel Menu


[10/14/2025 2:34 PM] mynt_the_derg
H makes sense.


[10/14/2025 2:38 PM] hopadamaron
Perhaps I should’ve consulted the keybinds before going full speed ahead


[10/14/2025 2:39 PM] mynt_the_derg

ive been saving up water chips for a while so that when i get the perks i can set up some water purifiers. ive built 3 industrial ones and they are not automatically producing purified water. ive waited like 3 or 4 days in total, asnd nothing. i seem to be producing dirty water maybe? any ideas on whats going on? could it be supply lines? i have maybe 5 settlements with less than 30 ppl total hooked up in a line. im producing like 300 water, i even set some advanced water purifier stations up for ppl to work and even that isnt automatically produing water. any ideas?


[10/15/2025 12:28 AM] mkdevst8r
ik i can manually fill bottles but man, it seems like a pain especially considering settlers will drink them for water requirements.


[10/15/2025 12:30 AM] hopadamaron
I think this was just so players can’t crash the economy with water, either way you can still make botttles with glass which is very easy to come by


[10/15/2025 12:30 AM] kagewune
Where'd you get em from


[10/15/2025 12:30 AM] kagewune
the water chips


[10/15/2025 12:31 AM] kagewune
Also has it always been normal for explosions to kill you around objects? Like through entire buildings?


[10/15/2025 12:32 AM] mkdevst8r
Man it's such a pain standing there doing it just for settlers to drink them. I'm just trying to stop getting ready poisoning and make some CP Dita or whatever they're called 😂


[10/15/2025 12:32 AM] mkdevst8r
The bucket on the side is certainly helpful and I'll do that if I have to but I really don't wanna haha

You can also craft them in utility bench. You need nuclear fanatic 3, it's kinda costly BUT || it also lets you craft fusion cores so ||


[10/15/2025 12:41 AM] hopadamaron
It’s not like it makes the whole hardcore thing go away, it only helps me out in the beginning area


[10/15/2025 12:41 AM] hopadamaron
And plus red rocket is def the type of place to have a water fountain


[10/15/2025 12:44 AM] mkdevst8r

[10/15/2025 1:32 AM] kregond
make x11-stim they remove 600 rads in stead of 60 for the new radaway (Ca-DTPA, I wonder why changing the name lol, radway is almost as symbolic as stimpak) and are cheap if you have some medic perks (you get really cheap stimpak-2 which can make x11-stim). As for the water chips, looking at their base price, they seem money to me rather than purified water lol. I suspect both of these would be balanced later tho.


[10/15/2025 1:33 AM] yami_ger
There is also mutaway whichvisbpretty easy to make aswell for rads


[10/15/2025 1:37 AM] kregond
I think water fountain should work with some basic water purification system, maybe add a requirement or dependency on water purification rather than magically pumping out purified water? Also I just been to vault 81 their water fountain does nothing to my thirst, no idea why. Also they removed water provision from the basic water pump, which is weird, at least have one maybe? Also I just learned that radboy is used for monitoring your IRA, which is really much more useful than that voice notification which I first confused them with weather warning only.


[10/15/2025 1:46 AM] blastbeats
is it normal to still take rads without a gasmask even when radboy says it's safe?

[10/15/2025 7:17 AM] nomad5157
It’s because like said above people will crash economy. It produces dirty water and the intended effect is you have to purify the water yourself. It just needs to be named differently to avoid confusion

In 0.6 we are bringing back tools required to craft, water will be a thing where you need to purify until you can actually unlock an actual advanced purifier. Ammo will require military surplus rounds to craft some of the high tier ammo and on top of requiring some types of manufacturing

For the Concord clear all hostiles quest bug, does anyone know of any other tricks besides doing the setstage mq102 122 console command?


[10/15/2025 10:38 AM] jimbiscus
I had that issue, resurrected a raider on the ground & killed them again. worked for me

Darn, I tried that as well but no luck! I resurrected a raider, Gris, the deathclaw lol


[10/15/2025 10:49 AM] ursorenda
A lot of times that bug is due to a raider being stuck in a wall. Try killall in a few different spots in concord, and remember that there *may* be a raider inside the museum trying to get to where you were on the roof

[10/15/2025 11:06 AM] toastonrye
Yea I tried going overboard last night. I split Concord into quadrants and did killall in each, plus a few interiors like the Museum. It's not a big deal, just a curiosity


[10/15/2025 11:09 AM] toastonrye
I was also wondering how people figure out quest stages, if perhaps a mod changed the quest ID from the MQ102 I found online


[10/15/2025 11:20 AM] stinky6764
@Nomad hey mate, I have made my game work somehow... It just works... took me some time but it works 🙂


[10/15/2025 11:21 AM] stinky6764
I can open MCM and it loaded everything.


[10/15/2025 11:23 AM] nomad5157
Quest IDs from vanilla fallout 4 should not change. If a mod did that then shame on that mod author lol


[10/15/2025 11:24 AM] nomad5157
MQ102 is a real pain to work with sometimes that’s why it has a lot of issues with modded setups it just has a lot of stages in general and sometimes things do not fire like they should. It’s one of the reasons we do not  have the game unpaused while in your inventory because the mod that does that can sometimes cause Preston to never show up on the balcony


[10/15/2025 11:43 AM] toastonrye

Nah haven’t got to that level yet but I could import this in at some point maybe


[10/15/2025 1:30 PM] lateralus9290
One frag grenade might be enough, that deathclaw is a weaker version. Alternatively, you can sneak to the right in an alley toward the spawn of the deathclaw. Usually the raiders move more forward so it's safe. Get close enough and the deathclaw will spawn and chaos follows. Let the raiders deal with the mess, and you collect loot.


[10/15/2025 1:31 PM] president_bushido
The deathclaw killed all the raiders, some ghouls and a synth robot and took 4 grenades to kill and a Molotov.


[10/15/2025 1:33 PM] lateralus9290
4 frag grenades? That is doubtful, those things can clear entire streets. On my first playthrough I had a hunting rifle by the time I got there. Took 3 headshots to kill it at full health.
In my current playthrough, it fought 2 raiders. I used one frag and it crippled it's legs and was pretty much dead at that point.


[10/15/2025 1:34 PM] president_bushido
We had vastly different experiences


[10/15/2025 1:36 PM] lateralus9290
Then I don't really have any helpfull tips, That amount of carnage to kill the first deathclaw is way more than I ever experienced. Maybe instead of dmg, prioritize crippling the legs, or try the grenade next to a car to combine the explosions. If all else fails you can always use console to 'kill' it


[10/15/2025 1:37 PM] president_bushido
The funny thing is, the 4th grenade did explode the car and then I still needed a Molotov. It was crazy. Maybe it got buffed


[10/15/2025 1:37 PM] president_bushido
It was scary for sure


[10/15/2025 1:37 PM] nomad5157
A lot of players get stuck in this mindset that they must absolutely b line to concord….that is not the case in anomaly


[10/15/2025 1:38 PM] lateralus9290
Not sure about that, as I said, frag grenades are OP as hell and I always carry at least 3 in case I meet a deathclaw/bears or a group of super mutants


[10/15/2025 1:39 PM] lateralus9290
Or just get on top of a roof and dump the most useless ammo, in my case thats usualy energy


[10/15/2025 1:39 PM] president_bushido
I’m the kind of player where I like to follow a quest or direction, would it be possible in the future to somehow let the player know they need to not go to concord first thing? It was tough for sure but I kinda thought it was just meant to be challenging


[10/15/2025 1:40 PM] nomad5157
It’s entirely up to you to go there


[10/15/2025 1:40 PM] lateralus9290
Also, I think if you attack it while it's getting through the hole in the ground, you don't deal damage


[10/15/2025 1:40 PM] nomad5157
Just  don’t expect you will be dealing with a vanilla like experience in that area


[10/15/2025 1:41 PM] nomad5157
They are being nerfed in 0.6 :p


[10/15/2025 1:43 PM] lateralus9290
well, at least I will be able to give grenades to followers without them blowing themselves, or me up. I don't think the AI is aware of the explosion radius


[10/15/2025 1:46 PM] nomad5157
I personally raised the radius and removed the flag of explosions it doing anything between walls. As in hiding behind a piece of dry wood. In terms of reality explosions would blow through these old 200 year walls easily but the game engine is very limited in what can be done


[10/15/2025 1:47 PM] nomad5157
So 0.6 it will be dialed down and that flag added back for sake of avoiding issues


[10/15/2025 1:49 PM] lateralus9290
Do frag nades ragdoll enemies, or will they? Hard to tell as they seem to kill everything instantly for me to notice


[10/15/2025 1:53 PM] nomad5157

Oeh been a hot sec since I download the pack but I believe an option on wabbajack when first installing


[10/15/2025 4:52 PM] keplarion
You (should?) be able to go back and activate it


[10/15/2025 4:53 PM] reversalshadow7540
It will be in the mod organizer in the optional mod settings then you go into mcm to set keybinds make sure your out of the vault first


[10/15/2025 4:54 PM] oloblil
Got it

[10/15/2025 5:07 PM] toastonrye
Pretty sure you do it once for each character, and any future updates that are save safe with your current version. And if you die before saving, apply them again


[10/15/2025 5:11 PM] reversalshadow7540
Gotcha ill make sure to do it again


[10/15/2025 6:17 PM] thracian8519_71863
the no jumping issue seems to be very common, anyone know the fix?


[10/15/2025 6:30 PM] yami_ger
Reset controls helped me


[10/15/2025 6:35 PM] seanlegacy
I was having random issues with some effects applying and when fixing them the effects where still present but not shown and then would randomly stop effecting my character either by restarting the game or reloading the save lol it was driving me nuts because my AP would instantly drain when trying to sprint when i had no effects that'd make that happen xD


[10/15/2025 6:36 PM] seanlegacy
Also gained an ANTImaterial rifle early game but having no ammo to use it was painful TwT


[10/15/2025 6:44 PM] kregond
I have similar issues, a unshown effect havling all my weapons damage, and fix after restarting the game. no jump for me could also be fixed with restart.


[10/15/2025 6:46 PM] kregond
I got a legendary gauss and a anti-tank rifle and ammo early game. As for ammo, they sell them at vendors. They also sell anti-material rifle and tis ammo iirc even from start.


[10/15/2025 6:47 PM] seanlegacy
I know but at that time I didn't have enough funds to afford ammo for it xD I got ammo now but I'm saving it for super mutants because those pains in the ass can take some serious damage. I have a decent Gauss rifle for the robots but not legendary, nice find!


[10/15/2025 6:48 PM] thiagobhds
Hi


[10/15/2025 6:49 PM] thracian8519_71863
how do you do that ?


[10/15/2025 6:49 PM] thiagobhds
I have a problem with excessive darkness in the mod fallout 2287 gas mask .


[10/15/2025 6:50 PM] thiagobhds
Has anyone else had this problem when putting on the mask? Can you help me solve it?


[10/15/2025 7:37 PM] kregond
Same! despite having a gauss, I had only 20 2ec for special occasions, they are expensive ammo and hard to find


[10/15/2025 7:39 PM] kregond
I'm not sure if it's bugged, putting on the mask would make it somehow grayscale and dark. You should provide a screenshot or sth?


[10/15/2025 7:39 PM] oloblil
What's the bullet time mod? I activate it by pressing g but I want to rebind it, and I also haven't found the vats key either lol


[10/15/2025 7:39 PM] kregond
vafs, it replace vats in this modlist


[10/15/2025 7:40 PM] oloblil
Thanks, I assumed it was in the combat menu and not user interface


[10/15/2025 7:44 PM] reaper83171
does anyone know why the sliders in advanced options dont work when creating your character? when move your sliders to increase muscles or any body slider it puffs off the body making look weird and before you say what mods you have i have no mods added and i had this same problem with the older versions as well.


[10/15/2025 7:47 PM] thiagobhds
I'm reinstalling the package from scratch. But one thing is to darken, the visual texture was stupidly dark during the day, it looked like it was a night without a full moon where I couldn't see anything 1 meter in front


[10/15/2025 7:48 PM] kregond
That sounds like something's wrong, probably not the intended slight dark of mask


[10/15/2025 7:49 PM] thiagobhds
Exactly, it wasn't light, it was too dark. But now I'm reinstalling from scratch, I cleaned everything to test again.


[10/15/2025 7:51 PM] thiagobhds
I don't know if it has to do with my 4k monitor, because I had to edit the fallou4prefs.ini to recognize my resolution


[10/15/2025 7:54 PM] seanlegacy
I have the Gauss for Mecanical creatures, I have the Anti Tank for supers lol


[10/15/2025 7:59 PM] kregond
I use hunting rifle as main now, swap to 30-06, ammos cheap, Anti-Tank and its ammo are too heavy lol, feels like a sniper fat boy. The gauss is ballistic damage even tho it's under energy weapon, so I think it should be the same as anti-tank damage-type wise?


[10/15/2025 8:15 PM] seanlegacy
Its suppose to be energy because it uses energy base bullistics lol


[10/15/2025 10:19 PM] .skeetin

Is there a hotkey to turn laser sights on and off? I don't see an option in the autobeam settings


[10/15/2025 11:48 PM] selura
Quick question, some things need a specific skill rank. Let's say, gunsmithing rank 1. How much points do I need to invest in gunsmithing to reach rank 1?


[10/16/2025 12:00 AM] yami_ger
Iirc 2

[10/16/2025 12:09 AM] selura
So, 25 for rank 1, 50 for rank 2 and so on?


[10/16/2025 12:09 AM] kregond
check mod config (mcm) for gameplay-you are exceptional-passive perks, note some perks are diabled by default. gunsmithing 25, 50, 75, 100. local leader 1 supply lines influence 15.


[10/16/2025 12:09 AM] kregond
all passive perks are listed under that config, so you could check them all if you want


[10/16/2025 12:49 AM] yami_ger
Yep


[10/16/2025 12:49 AM] selura
thx


[10/16/2025 3:10 AM] lateralus9290
Is ammo crafting locked behind a specific perk/book? I'm pretty far in with 75 gunsmithing, but I only have handfull of ammo options for crafting. Or is this in engineering/something else?


[10/16/2025 3:10 AM] yami_ger
You need to reverse engineering some ammo types like fusion core qnt the bench where xou learn the new benches


[10/16/2025 3:22 AM] lateralus9290
I'm just looking for ballistic ones, mainly 12.5 or 30-06. I can craft some high calliber rounds in the ammo workbench, but I don't think I've ever seen a gun that is using those.


[10/16/2025 3:56 AM] thracian8519_71863
Yeah i tried that already. Also tried the ini fix and moving the control map file. Still no luck. Maybe a complete reinstall?


[10/16/2025 5:43 AM] hopadamaron
Just to be safe, reverify the files on steam and then reinstall


[10/16/2025 6:40 AM] riflepoet
hi guys, are the long scopes on rifles supposed to be see through when you just carry them around? Right now I just get a black blob on the scope


[10/16/2025 6:51 AM] lateralus9290
I think they are meant to be see through only when you aim


[10/16/2025 6:59 AM] riflepoet
ah ok


[10/16/2025 7:00 AM] riflepoet
ok, next thing: can I assign a special hotkey to the butchering menu? I jsut want a quick loot pickup, not go through a menu everytime


[10/16/2025 7:11 AM] eldritchwat
when can i expect an answer from the support team with my ticket?


[10/16/2025 7:35 AM] lateralus9290
Yes you can, I had the same issue. Open the MCM menu and find the hotkey in the hunters of the commonwealth mod section


[10/16/2025 7:53 AM] riflepoet
ah awesome, thank you


[10/16/2025 7:53 AM] riflepoet
ok, next thing: the colored paperdoll, is that armor or limb damage, is there an explanation of hat exactly it displays?


[10/16/2025 7:59 AM] lateralus9290
If you mean the figure in the bottom left, it shows the limb health. There is a smaller one next to it which just shows which armor pieces you have on I think


[10/16/2025 8:00 AM] riflepoet
ah yes


[10/16/2025 8:00 AM] riflepoet
and limb health does not regenerate


[10/16/2025 8:02 AM] lateralus9290
For limbs to heal, use medicine or rest. Keep in mind that crippled limbs must first be 'fixed' to 1 health and then you can use a different medicine to heal the health of those limbs. Dumping limb health medicine on a broken leg does nothing, fix it first


[10/16/2025 8:02 AM] riflepoet
next thing: I have a scope that has the number 4 and the number 6 in display, is there a way to increase the zoom?


[10/16/2025 8:02 AM] riflepoet
or is that jsut for fun?


[10/16/2025 8:04 AM] lateralus9290
That is the remington weapon mod. Check MCM weapons section, the hotkey is not bound by default. Some scopes can be swtiched, but only for that gun I believe. There are scopes with integrated NG mode as well as built in iron sights for close combat.


[10/16/2025 8:21 AM] riflepoet
ah thank you


[10/16/2025 8:21 AM] riflepoet
lol ok next thing: I have Survival 50 already but I cant cook any dog meat or antryhing


[10/16/2025 8:22 AM] riflepoet
is that under something else?


[10/16/2025 8:24 AM] riflepoet
no, I switched the hotkey and get an error remington is not equipped


[10/16/2025 8:25 AM] lateralus9290
What weapon you have out?


[10/16/2025 8:25 AM] riflepoet
its a scrap battlerifle with a short scope


[10/16/2025 8:25 AM] lateralus9290
That is not a remington, remington is basically the hunting rifle now


[10/16/2025 8:25 AM] riflepoet
ok


[10/16/2025 8:26 AM] riflepoet
next thing lol


[10/16/2025 8:27 AM] riflepoet
I built a scrapping station and assigned osmeone to it


[10/16/2025 8:27 AM] riflepoet
waht does it do exactly???


[10/16/2025 8:28 AM] riflepoet
lol im always hungry


[10/16/2025 8:29 AM] riflepoet
why cant I cook dog meat and grill it lol


[10/16/2025 8:37 AM] lateralus9290
They will gather junk items over time. Not sure on the dog meat, I've not invested much in survival this playthrough so I dont really cook food, other than bake tatos, which is in my opinion way to easy with no negative side.
It might be locked at a higher level of the skill

hmm


[10/16/2025 9:16 AM] riflepoet
my limb damage is not healing


[10/16/2025 9:16 AM] riflepoet
rested for 14 hours


[10/16/2025 9:17 AM] lateralus9290
is it crippled?


[10/16/2025 9:25 AM] riflepoet
no


[10/16/2025 9:25 AM] riflepoet
jsut yellow


[10/16/2025 9:26 AM] riflepoet
but it will get crippled if it keeps going like that


[10/16/2025 9:26 AM] riflepoet
in pip boy the damage is about halfway


[10/16/2025 9:32 AM] lateralus9290
hm, maybe resting no longer heals them


[10/16/2025 9:43 AM] riflepoet
so doctor only?


[10/16/2025 9:48 AM] lateralus9290
IFAK/Splint to fix a broken limb to 1 health, then ibuprofen to recover health on that limb, or stimpak mk2 I think


[10/16/2025 10:00 AM] riflepoet
ibuprofen worked then resting


[10/16/2025 10:04 AM] lateralus9290
Then it was probably just the ibuprofen. Guess resting does not heal limbs, HP only I guess


[10/16/2025 10:08 AM] tiburse

[10/16/2025 10:33 AM] toastonrye
Lead belly should be a perk you get for free at like level 15 if you can make it there without dying from rads lol. The story of a 200 year old cryo chamber person adapting to a new environment


[10/16/2025 12:58 PM] kregond
Lead belly looks a bit OP imo, rank 3 make you immune to disease and rads from food, meaning survival is no longer survival, maybe change rank 3 to reduce 66% rads as an upgrade to rank 2's 50%. I took the first two without much thought and now I hesitate on the third perk bc of losing the fun to select food to eat. Also baked tato is too easy to get as well, they are now the new noodle cup (also carrot juice).


[10/16/2025 1:00 PM] toastonrye
Yea I'm only level 9 but using baked tatos, no lead belly


[10/16/2025 1:00 PM] kregond
and yeah unlock lead belly with survival skill sounds a good idea, you eat more wasteland trash to get your system mor accustomed to it.


[10/16/2025 1:02 PM] lateralus9290
Any way to set follower distance? Really getting tired of them sneaking 'through' me only for me to shoot them by accident, wasting a round, sneak attack on an enemy, and a stimpak


[10/16/2025 1:03 PM] kregond
There's two perks for those two, one under influence to cancel friendly damage, the other under sneak to make all follower sneaky sneak


[10/16/2025 1:05 PM] kregond
Also there's AFT, maybe in combat AI you could do sth about that.


[10/16/2025 1:06 PM] kregond
I don't know the max amount of followers in the modlist, but now I have 6 and the problem of sneak and shoot them also become visibly annoying. But for some reason, most of the time my follower just walk in front of enemies without them noticing them.

Has anyone started the game up and being stuck at the start of the game after you create your character? Not a loading screen tho?


[10/16/2025 6:42 PM] lateralus9290
The basic ilnesses are the same as in vanilla F4
Insomnia - more sleep
Weakness - more damage
Parasites - more hungry
Infection = periodic damage
Then there are radiation bases diseases/debuffs such as periodic radiation, random character falling on the ground, etc. 
As for the filter, glowing red means that you are in an irradiated area. Although it sometimes gets stuck glowing after the radiation passes


[10/16/2025 6:47 PM] johnny_bucking

[10/16/2025 7:17 PM] mkdevst8r
i just cheesed it on the roof, headshots do crazy damage on this its not too hard to kill it


[10/16/2025 7:19 PM] elchris326
yeah i’ll have to do that then do you know how i get the training?


[10/16/2025 7:20 PM] mkdevst8r
im not sure, you could check the mod page if you need to know.

https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/65671


[10/16/2025 7:20 PM] mkdevst8r
i dont usually use power armor so i havent bothered trying to find someone, tho i imagine theyll be close to some mid point quests or factions so its not too dificult to find naturally


[10/16/2025 7:22 PM] elchris326
yeah that would make sense i appreciate the help

go here #🆘support-channel  and make a ticket.


[10/16/2025 8:01 PM] mynt_the_derg
In concord there's a holodisc in the vertiberd. That'll give you a hint as to where.


[10/16/2025 8:41 PM] toastonrye
Did you end up adding additional mods?


[10/16/2025 8:42 PM] kingfireball0101
I’m download some right now.. I’ll give you a update if it works


[10/16/2025 8:45 PM] toastonrye
Have you been able to play at all without adding additional mods? Not all mods are compatible.


[10/16/2025 8:48 PM] kingfireball0101
No I think I need an alternative start. The game start up good just when you exit the Cryochamber he don’t exit he falls through the floor.. I can hear sound. But I get a weird picture!


[10/16/2025 8:52 PM] doc7070
why am I not holding my breath even though my scope is 6-10x?  Holding breath works on my other sniper rifle


[10/16/2025 9:01 PM] doc7070
I figured it out - the scope I was using wasn't compatible even though the description matched my current, aside from STS.  The STS version doesn't work and has less zoom even though they should have same range

Has any one figured out how to start the game outside of the vault? Like an alternative start?


[10/16/2025 10:50 PM] nomad5157
It will be in 0.6 you can look at announcements to see


[10/16/2025 10:51 PM] kingfireball0101
My apologies I spoke to soon I figured it out… I just add a new mod the fix that problem I was having with the floor in the beginning of the game


[10/17/2025 1:11 AM] oloblil
The first section of this game is pretty fucking infuriating tbh


[10/17/2025 1:14 AM] oloblil
It's really Bethesda';s fault for thinking that waves of raiders and a deathclaw is how you should start your game


[10/17/2025 1:21 AM] toastonrye
I've seen it mentioned here before, and it isn't explicitly obvious to the player but you don't have to go to Concord immediately. I kind of circled the area and assigned a few perks to defense/offensive as well as got familiar with the harsh damage mechanics.

[10/17/2025 1:23 AM] toastonrye
There is a perk under medicine at 30 skill which does bonus damage to raiders or other human type enemies that seems very valuable to get asap.


[10/17/2025 1:37 AM] yami_ger
I mean concord is also easy whwb you cns get the ghouls to attack the raider on top


[10/17/2025 1:43 AM] toastonrye
Yup, manipulating the various factions to engage in combat with each other is always fun. And in this mod list all the extra ghouls is a bit of a surprise the first time you encounter them in the Concord area lol

Hey everyone - I'm having an issue installing Anomaly using Jackify (the Linux Wabbajack), has anyone had any similar issues? Basically I get to the end but it can't install these 2 archives, one from a Google drive, one from elsewhere

I have a short video of the logs, idk if it's appropriate to attach here


[10/17/2025 2:24 AM] toastonrye
which mods?


[10/17/2025 2:24 AM] quill_rumination
Just the anomaly mod list so far - the only additjon I plan to make (later) is Pip-Pad


[10/17/2025 2:25 AM] quill_rumination
Can I attach the video so you can see what I'm talking about? It's short only like 25 sec


[10/17/2025 2:29 AM] toastonrye
I'm not sure the rules around that. However it can probably be linked if you make a support ticket.


[10/17/2025 2:29 AM] toastonrye
I saw a post from yesterday saying they are getting to the tickets, but the team is just really busy


[10/17/2025 3:05 AM] lateralus9290
Did the check the guide if the error is listed there with a solution?


[10/17/2025 4:37 AM] kagewune
worth mentioning that if you hide in one of the buildings in concord outside of the museum then the deathclaw can't get to you, its cheesing it but it took me 100 tries to get past the raiders so its fair game lol

[10/17/2025 9:41 AM] weabootyler
No jokes, this was the tactic in Fallujah. They used ladders and the such to breach from top down and some would load the IFV packed full of grenades. Talking 15-30 per person sometimes more. They'd just chuck grenades down the steps, in rooms etc etc.... then climb from one roof to another and repeat the process. That's where this iconic image comes from and this dude in the photo is now a accountant lmao

Hey, I am 24+ hours into my first playthrough and I have been able to wear helmets and night vision equipped with a gas mask until recently, now it just automatically unequips the mask. Can I fix this or is this just normal? It is the same helmet I have been using for 10+ hours. Just looked up that you're not supposed to get rads during clear weather without a gas mask, should I just disable that portion of the mod?


[10/17/2025 11:56 AM] thericklessmorty5631
I dunno if anyone else is having this issue but this is my second time trying to download this mod list. Yesterday 56 files failed to download, and today it's 76 files.. so I have to manually download 76 files and that is going to take days..not hours..


[10/17/2025 11:57 AM] thericklessmorty5631
Why can't we just use Vortex? We're already getting the mods from Nexus..

and to top it off the manually download files keep stopping saying to check the internet and resume.. too bad I've got a decent wifi and I'm using an ethernet cable to help out.. I've modded many games and STALKER GAMMA was kinda easy to dowload but this modlist is insane with so many problems.. If anyone else is having these issues please let me know how you fixed it or got around all the problems.

{Reactions}

[10/17/2025 12:56 PM] kregond
I manually downloaded a lot of them, I would do the smaller ones first (wabbajack should have a feature to download small mods first imo, but Idk how they arrange their download order). Also if you fail download it's probably some internet problem, try use a vpn. Most of the failures for me are due to time out, if wabbajack fail, download them via browser.

I'm logged in on Nexus through wabbajack.

I just joined chat, I can help, just dm me and give me the specifics


[10/17/2025 1:11 PM] hopadamaron
There should be a folder called downloads within the folder where you’re installing the modlist, download it there


[10/17/2025 1:11 PM] thericklessmorty5631
thanks


[10/17/2025 1:11 PM] toastonrye
Is it possible it's just an issue with Nexus? I've had that in the past where if you don't have premium the downloads are kinda bad... I explicitly got premium for this list and it was a breeze


[10/17/2025 1:12 PM] hopadamaron
Yeah it’s kinda of a shitty situation, if you don’t have premium you have to manually download every mod


[10/17/2025 1:13 PM] thericklessmorty5631
I'd pay for premium but the only option it gives me it 89.99 for the year, the 8.99 option is greyed out and I can't pick it


[10/17/2025 1:13 PM] thericklessmorty5631

Immersive seems to do nothing, as in you can run around without it. Survival I think is radiaton at all times. You can check MCM for description on each of the presets

If you go to MCM settings, in the user interface category there are like two pages of interest, one is a hotkey manager that seems to collect a bunch of interesting hot keys from various mods. That's the best list I've found.

I have manually placed the correct version of the enb file in my FalloutAnomaly/downloads but im still getting the same error.  I see a message way back that says I have to use the install from disk option but thats asking for a file with the wabbajack extension?


[10/18/2025 5:12 PM] lateralus9290
Anyone encountered a strange bug where you'd get massive dose of radiation when in an external cell, but under a roof or in a house? I was in the entrance of diamond city during rain. Once I got under the roof, I stopped getting <1 rads from the rain. After a little while it spiked to 40+. I still had my mask on, so I have no clue what just happened. Unless I didnt have the mask but due to graphical bug, I thought I did.
This is also happening while in sanctuary, where I even have the air filter. Radiation just randomly spikes with no warning.


[10/18/2025 5:30 PM] yami_ger
Is your filter at 100% of the gasmask also the air filter for workshops has an certain range whixh i think on lvl1 is like 15m


[10/18/2025 5:46 PM] hopadamaron
Even if im standing next to the air filter id still get hit with massive rads, it might’ve been solved since i just reinstalled the list tho


[10/18/2025 5:53 PM] kingfireball0101
Have anyone ran into a problem with the graphics right after you come out the vault. And going to sanctuary the road graphics, flickering in & flicker out.. is there anything I can do to fix that?


[10/18/2025 5:57 PM] hopadamaron
I’m running into some graphical issues myself, I’m just reinstalling the modlist til I get it right


[10/18/2025 6:00 PM] kingfireball0101
Yeah I’m not sure if it a bug or loadorder problem but i have the same problem with the gas mask when I put it on.. the icon in the top left corner doesn’t show up. maybe it’s just because I don’t have no gas mask filter yet to make it pop up but I’m not sure yet. I’m still in sanctuary testing mods that I added myself.


[10/18/2025 6:01 PM] kingfireball0101
Having graphic issue where at?


[10/18/2025 6:04 PM] hopadamaron

I’m not an expert at modding our graphics except..  I just started 2 days ago on this game and getting it up and running.


[10/18/2025 6:10 PM] hopadamaron
I just loaded a save where I was outside, and then loaded back in


[10/18/2025 6:10 PM] kingfireball0101
Just looking for tips on a lookout in the future when I come to it so I can fix it ahead of time

[10/18/2025 6:12 PM] hopadamaron
A few hours now


[10/18/2025 6:12 PM] kingfireball0101
Oh ok you just started too


[10/18/2025 6:49 PM] lateralus9290
I have a fully upgraded base filter and it's placed near the workbench. Gas filter was at 20%

Anyone else have an issue where they can't switch out their gas mask filter? Tried both the hotkey and manually in my inventory


[10/18/2025 8:05 PM] hunter8008
Has anyone else had an issue where they reload a save after sleeping and it's just a black screen? The game's loaded in, it's just black with the load icon at the bottom


[10/18/2025 8:41 PM] toastonrye
Yes, I've encountered that periodically and not sure what it's from. It's only happened a few times so I've went back to a prior save


[10/18/2025 9:13 PM] maskeyato
is there a explanation of what each preset is at the start of the game?


[10/18/2025 9:13 PM] toastonrye
which preset?


[10/18/2025 9:14 PM] maskeyato
all of them really whats the difference between the default, survival and immersion preset?


[10/18/2025 9:15 PM] toastonrye
I just picked the  one called Pick this for Fallout Anomaly Default, it seems like the mod list is balanced around it


[10/18/2025 9:16 PM] maskeyato
mk ty does default still have the food system?


[10/18/2025 9:17 PM] toastonrye
i believe those presets are strictly related to the gas mask mod. Like if rads accumulate only during rain.


[10/18/2025 9:17 PM] maskeyato
o


[10/18/2025 9:18 PM] toastonrye
Am I not looking at the right thing? It says gas masks on the pop up window


[10/18/2025 9:19 PM] maskeyato
"this update adds gas masks to fallout anomaly..." i think so


[10/18/2025 9:19 PM] maskeyato
its at the very start of the game


[10/18/2025 9:19 PM] maskeyato
still in the cryo pod etc


[10/18/2025 9:20 PM] toastonrye
Yea sounds right


[10/18/2025 9:20 PM] maskeyato
okay ty for help


[10/18/2025 9:20 PM] toastonrye
These are settings that can be adjusted after the fact in the MCM settings for gas masks. I don't believe those presets are locked in, I'd still suggest selecting the one recommended for fallout anomaly

It's not, there's save on exit


[10/18/2025 10:32 PM] joekillera
It prompts you as well


[10/18/2025 10:33 PM] maskeyato
okay i see it so the alt way to save is to smoke ?


[10/18/2025 10:33 PM] joekillera
Yeah, you'll find cartons of cigs and packs, you unpack them and smoke the cigs. Sleeping as well saves

there multiple ways actually, APC transport, you find them down the road from Red Rocket; then there's abandoned tunnel, which you also find the first one on the road from Sanctury to RR; The tunnel of the subways, but I haven't tried them yet, they have many enemies inside and are very limited for fast travel.

Has anyone gotten this running on the Steam Deck?


[10/19/2025 5:07 AM] quill_rumination
Also, is it worth using something like

https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23316  in a modlist like this if I'm playing on Steam Deck or is it liable to do more harm than good?


[10/19/2025 6:19 AM] clipper3156
good morning all can anyone tell me how to upgrade my gun ? what perk i need as it tells me i need gun nut 1 2 so on but i cant see them in the perk list


[10/19/2025 6:25 AM] lateralus9290
Gunsmithing for most balistic weapons. Some require the cowpoke or how its called as well. While energy weapons need mostly science.


[10/19/2025 6:30 AM] clipper3156
thank you i had level 1 perk nut need to add more to gunsmithing to be able to use it will this be the the same for making ammo also like 308?


[10/19/2025 6:35 AM] lateralus9290
For mods, its every 25 skill points per rank. Regarding ammo, I still haven't figured that out, I know that the character background unlocks some ammo type. No idea how to unlock more ammo in the bench


[10/19/2025 6:40 AM] kregond
For ammo, you first unlock ammo bench via engineering bench, then reverse engineering most ammo types by researching ammo schematics at the engineering bench after having built ammo bench


[10/19/2025 6:41 AM] kregond
for example for .308 you need 100 rounds of .308 to reverse engineer and get the schematics iirc on the engineer bench, then craft them or recycle them on the ammo bench


[10/19/2025 6:44 AM] kregond
I seriously doubt Steam Deck could be capable of running this modlist. I don't have Steam Deck but this modlist is somehow heavy on the system requirement.


[10/19/2025 6:45 AM] clipper3156
oh thanks a lot to both of you have have a great day


[10/19/2025 6:47 AM] lateralus9290
Thanks, I only built the ammo bench thinking that gunsmithery will unlock it.


[10/19/2025 6:58 AM] kregond
the crafting indeed is confusing at times. I haven't figure out why my electronic and decal bench is almost empty with nothing to craft


[10/19/2025 8:24 AM] lateralus9290
I don't have an option to reverse engineer anything :/
Nevermind, turns out I had to 'unlock' ammo bench again, even though I have it placed already

[10/19/2025 11:06 AM] j4eyun
What's the correct damage for the Kimber Custom Pistol? When I first got it, the damage was listed as 3. I had to use two magazines to kill a fly. I thought this damage was too low, so I watched YouTube videos of people playing Anomaly. Some people say it does 3 damage, while others say it's closer to 40. What's more confusing is that when I die, re-apply mcm, turn it off and on again, etc., the gun damage becomes 30. Which is correct?


[10/19/2025 11:31 AM] quill_rumination
Some people seem to be saying that it will run decently further up in the chat, but yeah idk

Can you elaborate on the graphical issues? How's your fps?

I was wondering if I could use Cathedral Assets Optimizer to downscale some of the 2k/4k textures or if that'd fuck it up lol


[10/19/2025 12:25 PM] kingfireball0101
No graphical issues I think it’s just a texture issue with the ground flickering and rear parenting and disappearing


[10/19/2025 12:25 PM] quill_rumination
Hm. How frequently?


[10/19/2025 12:27 PM] quill_rumination
Whelp, I've decided to lay Cyberpunk at the alter of Anomaly (I needed the disk space) I've played through it so many times that  I need a while before I can touch it again

Love it, but it's too familiar

God I wish they'd give us real mod tools and I wish we'd get stuff like Fallout and Skyrim have

Can't wait for the 2nd game with a proper engine either lol, they should have far less issues

Anyway, here's hoping for Anomaly 🤞


[10/19/2025 12:29 PM] quill_rumination
Also, it's not just me that's getting like 6-10+ hour installations for these Fallout packs, right? Like I know they're huge, but they were huge back in the day too, and I don't remember them taking quite THIS long..


[10/19/2025 12:31 PM] kingfireball0101
Quick question for anyone that may have the answer. With the perspective of you usually see enemies on your mini map highlighted red markers is that a feature that I have to unlock to see them on my mini map or it’s not on this model list feature


[10/19/2025 12:32 PM] quill_rumination
I'd put my bets on needing a piece of tech for that given the theme of the pack, but it could also just not be a thing for tactical difficulty


[10/19/2025 12:33 PM] quill_rumination
But given that I've literally never played it and am just speculating.. Lol

hey everyone, just came across this modlist on a youtube video and am very intrigued! i can see there's a lot of teases for 0.6 in the announcements. would it be worthwhile to download the list now and start a save, or should i just wait for 0.6 to come out at this point?


[10/19/2025 6:20 PM] komodo6474
I would download it and play for few hours to see if you like it, you can always start over, it’s a little overwhelming, so it would be good to get a feel for it. It’s challenging, frustrating and fun!


[10/19/2025 6:55 PM] toastonrye
I'd download it now and play. 0.6 sounds like a significant change to certain mechanics and there isn't an ETA either that I'm aware of

I spend half hour or one with constant stumbling and extreme slow movement to get to bethany in my first few hour of this modlist lol, to prevent such tragedy from occuring again you prevent your IRA and Rad getting high, Ca-DPTA is very weak but you can get those early on as well as alchol, later you use cleasning tonic for poisoning, refreshing beverage for IRA, X-111 or Mutaway for Rads. As long as you have low IRA and Rad there's no chance of these debuff and radiation poisoning. Use your Radboy check your IRA, also there's voice notification telling you your IRA level.

Does anyone know how to milk brahmin (Lead Belly Rank 1)? I crouch and could see the milk by R but nothing happens when I press R, tried kinds of bottles and milk cartons, no luck. or which mod does it belong to? YAE seems to be in charge of perks but found no info about how to milk brahmin there


[10/20/2025 4:05 AM] roggietheonly
Hey, I’m pretty new to the modpack, after many attempts I managed to complete the museum in concord, and limped and stumbled my way back to sanctuary with a fractured leg and my new buddies, but I have no idea how to fix the leg? My character keeps falling down


[10/20/2025 4:50 AM] hopadamaron
Look at your aid items, MAIM does a shit ton of changes


[10/20/2025 4:53 AM] roggietheonly
yeah, I actually did figure out how to fix my leg, now I'm trying to clear cesium cold and nuclear diarrhea and severe radiation poisoning since it rained for two days, and I had enabled the mod that takes off your helmet after combat lmfao. Got it disabled now! turns out the radiation poisoning is why I'm falling down so much


[10/20/2025 4:54 AM] hopadamaron
Because of my paranoia of rad poisoning I regularly take that item that clears rads and ira lol


[10/20/2025 5:02 AM] roggietheonly
I used all of mine up 😅 apparently the food I’ve been finding around is not good to eat lol, is there a meter that shows IRA? How bad is -4 IRA? Like from instamash. That kind of food seems like it’s wrecking me


[10/20/2025 5:03 AM] roggietheonly
Also I have no idea how to harvest wheat


[10/20/2025 5:03 AM] roggietheonly
Meat* not wheat


[10/20/2025 5:24 AM] roggietheonly
Holy crap I have no idea how to survive this, I’m trying to get purified water so that I can craft some rad treatments and now there’s a full on radiation storm and not one of the houses in sanctuary count as being sheltered


[10/20/2025 5:41 AM] lateralus9290
There is an underground shelter behind one of the houses. I did notice that the restored houses don't count as roof, which Is why I kept getting sick when sleeping. The only place that is 'sheltered' is the garage entrance in the house where the workbench is.
But I'm surprised you have a rad storm, those usually don't happen in the first day or two when starting


[10/20/2025 5:43 AM] roggietheonly
it ended up being very short, I just used the purified water at the water tower on the way to abernathy farms to craft rad treatments and used 4 of the basic ones, it barely put a dent in my radiation. I don't think I'm going to survive this run


[10/20/2025 5:44 AM] lateralus9290
Also, there is an underground tunnel system with a workbench that you can use as base.
Get first rank of lead belly as soon as possible. Also, drinks made with vegetable (corn/carrots) dont give radiation. Not sure on how high survival you need to make them though


[10/20/2025 5:49 AM] kregond
Use Radboy to check your IRA level, and a lot of other tips are in this discord, search a thing or two you would get them


[10/20/2025 5:50 AM] roggietheonly
I think I'm just going to start over, no med supplies, no food, water is setup at sanctuary, but the hand pump gives me more rads, and I can't drink or collect from the automated one, my movement speed is like .02 at this point and I fall over constantly so I can't fight anything or leave


[10/20/2025 5:51 AM] roggietheonly
I'm gonna start over, and setup a home base at red rocket with farms and stuff before doing much fighting or exploring I think.


[10/20/2025 5:53 AM] lateralus9290
Pick up farmer or hunter as the background to get decent survival/crops

having a weird bug where i can't jump and my cursor doesn't work on pipboy


[10/20/2025 6:26 AM] hopadamaron
It’s a little bit of cheating, but if you build a water fountain it gives you clean water


[10/20/2025 7:13 AM] kregond
Happens to me all the time randomly, restarting the game would fix it for me. In my case, the rightclick would work temporarily instead of the lef click and some buttons work some won't. Pipboy is still useable by using wasd or arrow keys. I will get to some point safe and restart the game after this bug occur.


[10/20/2025 7:13 AM] hopadamaron
Speaking of which it’s funny that the vault 111 water fountains still gives clean water despite a mushroom growing out of it


[10/20/2025 7:52 AM] mr.wolf
Yeah that's exactly the same but restarting the game every 5 minutes because of this weird issue won't be viable in the long term. I'm just wondering what's causing it in the first place.

Is there really people complaining about the IRA system ?


[10/20/2025 8:48 AM] 911reg
the IRA system is great imo, it can be slightly improved by doing smth such as adding a small widget for it rather than having to use an item to see the IRA value (to make it more intuitive) but other than that I wouldn't change it for nothin'

TLDR: 

Camping/temputature Mod
Stalker-like Anomaly Fields
New Power Armor training mod. 
Combat Overhaul.
Possible hunting mod.
Rads overhaul
Essentially all those core overhauls mods we are trying to make our own version of it.

[10/20/2025 10:37 AM] nomad5157
I noticed you got an issue at the end where you can't jump with that deathclaw. If you could revert a save before interacting with the butcher on it. Sorry for the inconvenience. There is a bug right now we are looking into that causes the player not to be able to jump and looking to try and fix it asap. I would avoid any hunting mechanics for the time being.

It is probably radiation poisoning or radiation sickness, get your IRA and Rad down first, cure your radiation poisoning by cleansing tonic. Or just find a doctor as suggested. Heather is good on everything medically-wise except for the radiation poisoning.

I had 300 cigs now so bascially they work like quicksave, open every cig carton and packets you find and you wouldn't need to worry about saving. I think they are too easy to get actually. If you had trouble finding them you could always buy them.


[10/21/2025 7:02 AM] roggietheonly
it's not that they're unavailible, it's that I have ADHD and constantly forget to use them. Is there a way to revert to a normal save system or not? because if I have to clear concord for the fifth time I'm gonna just stop playing lol

Don't just dont. It will make her not light up with thermal visor, but more importantly, it will make her not have a 'physical' body so she wont get hit by enemies while she will still fight back.

Part of the gimmick of this mod list and survival in general is the threat of losing time and progress. It's supposed to change the way you play, sometimes choosing to avoid combat instead of engaging or coming back to a fight or mission at a higher level.


[10/21/2025 12:28 PM] toastonrye
The only time it hurts to lose progress is if the game crashed or glitched majorly where it wasn't the players fault. Luckily I haven't had much of that... Yet lol

Yes toastonrye, I understand the purpose and why it’s there, all I asked is if there’s a way to disable that feature.


[10/21/2025 1:02 PM] nomad5157
Yes you can disable it. YMMV


[10/21/2025 1:18 PM] toastonrye
Is the final 0.5 save safe? I'll test when home later just curious.


[10/21/2025 1:19 PM] nomad5157
Its release date is still to be determined, and it will **not** be save-safe. Unfortunately, this is necessary to fix issues we’ve discovered with some of the scripted mods.


[10/21/2025 1:19 PM] toastonrye
Oh gotcha, I missed that it wasn't out

I always head at the beginning of game to get sniper rifle on dead raider in concord, with this mod it wasn’t there at the start which is okay, a few levels later I come back to use sleeping bag to save and now there’s a dead raider with the rifle next to him, this is so cool!

[10/21/2025 2:46 PM] nomad5157
there is no downscaling done. Either a hardware issue or something you missed in the guide. You can find help in https://discord.com/channels/1113971680419782666/1259594801125392494


[10/21/2025 2:50 PM] knowing_goyim
I read that it redirects to chat. When you say no overlays do you mean no nvidia frame logging either, im looking at my stats and im not bottlenecking on gpu or cpu the performance is just really bad.  Also i need rivatuner for other games so i havent removed it shouldnt disabling it be enough not to cause conflicts


[10/21/2025 2:51 PM] knowing_goyim
The only thing i didnt do from guide was disable hd textures but thats bc when i checked my they were already disabled by default


[10/21/2025 2:55 PM] knowing_goyim
Ill reread that but im pretty sure i went through


[10/21/2025 2:56 PM] nomad5157
Riva tuner should not be running when playing the list. You can open a support post via our bug report link in the channel I linked above and we can look more into it.


[10/21/2025 2:56 PM] knowing_goyim
No u


[10/21/2025 2:58 PM] nomad5157
any overlay in general can cause issues


[10/21/2025 2:58 PM] knowing_goyim
Im too lazy/entitled to submit a ticket. If youre telling me my specs should handle it like what are we talking about bc anything under 60 fps stable and my eyes hurt. If its supposed to be hitting 40 fps then i think ill swap lists.


[10/21/2025 2:58 PM] nomad5157
People play this list on laptops


[10/21/2025 2:59 PM] knowing_goyim
Then i will exhaust all options on my own end before wasting the teams time.


[10/21/2025 2:59 PM] nomad5157
The list is very optimized and if you're hitting 40fps and "slideshow" then it's an issue on your end


[10/21/2025 2:59 PM] knowing_goyim
I am intrigued by this list it appeals to me more than magnum opus

Is it the enb that causes such strong depth of field blurring ? i am in love with the modlist so far (aside from blocking me from choosing a few of my own keybinds) the blur hurts my head so much that i cannot play longer than 30-45 minutes before i start getting a headache

Go through all the work of getting the raider digest to unlock repairing gas maks, just to realize that you are not able to repair a marine armor helmet...... great


[10/21/2025 9:02 PM] .skeetin
Think its a bit stupid, as the marine helmet is meant less as a gas mask, and more as an actual helmet. Basically have to console command / cheat in a new one


[10/21/2025 9:35 PM] shalto
Dumb question but can you stealth in power armor in this modlist?

[10/21/2025 10:22 PM] doc7070
what are you supposed to do if you're on the other side of the map and you get raided?  My settlement of 13 has 40+ defense and still failed to defend it without me


[10/21/2025 10:22 PM] doc7070
kind of makes wish I never invested in it


[10/21/2025 11:29 PM] yami_ger
Depending on where it is either apc or the manholes


[10/22/2025 12:12 AM] kregond
I tend to stash most of resources in a safe spot where I'm always ready to defend, abandoned tunnel is a very good place for this.
You could read wiki about settlement defense(https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_4_settlements#Attack_success_chance), the least chance you have is 2% per day iirc even you max defense (max defense is 100-pop of settlement, more would be useless) and for a settlement with max defense and max water or food, the chance is still 30% to fail if you leave it auto defend. All this info are for vanilla, but I think anom didn't do much about settlement mechanics.


[10/22/2025 12:27 AM] shalto
question how long does it take for the game to l.oad the firs time?


[10/22/2025 12:28 AM] toastonrye
its likely variable for everyone, but for me maybe just under a minute before I see the fallout anomaly image load in


[10/22/2025 12:29 AM] toastonrye
and you are playing on an ssd?


[10/22/2025 12:31 AM] shalto
yes it loaded after i asked that. are we able to use creation club stuff in the modlist or is that locked?


[10/22/2025 12:32 AM] toastonrye
I'm not sure about how that works


[10/22/2025 12:36 AM] shalto
It finnaly installed for me today and i’m headed to bed so i wasnt sure if i would get to use the creation club power armor i like or not


[10/22/2025 12:46 AM] toastonrye
off the start, the power armour requires special training you won't be able to use it


[10/22/2025 12:57 AM] yami_ger
You would need to manually ibstall creation club stuff via zipping it up and installibg it liie a mod in mo2

Clear out the small raider camps around the area, don’t go straight to concord before getting some decent guns and armor


[10/23/2025 4:40 AM] lateralus9290
This. Also, I'd try to get to diamond city as soon as possible to unlock the manhole there (fast travel) and get piper asap. Then you can get a early game perk that raises all XP by 30% I think, as long as you have a human companion.


[10/23/2025 4:42 AM] hopadamaron
Yeah I think in the next update I’m not gonna hold off going to diamond city

[10/23/2025 7:48 AM] lateralus9290
I think the tunnels count as 'outside' so make sure to build a prefab with a roof and light for a bed placement. Otherwise you will keep getting sick

Might look into tweaking it myself later there's just so much stuff I have to do all the time I never feel like producing :Wojack_Bear:

Hint, raise your survival :) and cook tatos


[10/23/2025 1:27 PM] mynt_the_derg
zero Iras :)


[10/23/2025 1:27 PM] joekillera
You can easily get all of the needed mats for water refinement, required building perks and including 2 water chips sub level 12, and have means of working the water crafting bench without going further than concord. 

Theres one located below the slocum joe's and one in the superduper mart. Also just boiling water makes it not radioactive anymore and you get that at like survival level 30 with led belly?


[10/23/2025 1:27 PM] joekillera
+1 to tatos too


[10/23/2025 1:27 PM] yotsuhirasaka
Yeah, have been.

76 is just not in .. the graphics on that trailer are just 🤮


[10/23/2025 1:31 PM] nomad5157
yeah have to agree


[10/23/2025 1:31 PM] mynt_the_derg
76 was flawed from the start.

the next gen update was Such a Fuck you to the modders. ~~especially since it happened Right before A Major mod release that people were looking forwards to~~


[10/23/2025 1:37 PM] joekillera
press end and disable DOF


[10/23/2025 1:38 PM] joekillera
It'll be under the first box nearest the left, near the bottom


[10/23/2025 1:41 PM] joekillera
Can the UI be changed? I wanna adjust some of the placement of icons and if I can re-enable enemy HP bars.


[10/23/2025 1:42 PM] hunter8008
Appreciate it, much better now


[10/23/2025 1:45 PM] hunter8008
It's under "user interface" in the mod config. Go to immersive HUD, 3rd from the bottom

{Reactions}
🔥

[10/23/2025 1:47 PM] yotsuhirasaka
Under the FallUI section in MCM; 
Specifically FallUI-HUD and you may or may not want to adjust whether or not you're using Easy Mode (not sure if that was a me bug or a normal bug)


[10/23/2025 2:40 PM] wxdxr
Hey guys, I have a quick question. I’m using Wabbajack to install Anomaly — whenever there’s an update, does it download the whole modpack again or only the parts that changed? Do I need to keep the downloaded files on my drive so it can just verify and update what’s different?


[10/23/2025 2:46 PM] hope._.619
Can anyone tell me what is going on with the Steam market


[10/23/2025 3:29 PM] dagfinn_01993
is there a way to see which weather is currently loaded?  im using precipitation rads only and the sky looks clear but i still get doused in rads when removing my mask


[10/23/2025 3:33 PM] jimmy.the.fish
i believe the default hotkey is 7 on the numpad. you can also go into vivid weathers in the mcm and it'll tell you what hotkey for weather reports, and will let you change it to whatever you want


[10/23/2025 3:34 PM] dagfinn_01993
thanks do you happen to know why the screen goes quite dark when equipping a gas mask? i can hardly see where im going


[10/23/2025 3:35 PM] jimmy.the.fish
That i'm not sure of, sorry


[10/23/2025 3:36 PM] jimmy.the.fish
My best guess would be it's either related to the ENB (press end key for tweaking that) or something with the mask overlay (which you can play with in the MCM as well)


[10/23/2025 3:37 PM] dagfinn_01993
so i just checked and it was num 7 and it says clear vanilla but still taking rad damage with no mask 💀 .


[10/23/2025 3:38 PM] jimmy.the.fish
What preset did you click when starting the game?


[10/23/2025 3:38 PM] jimmy.the.fish
The anamoly preset should only have rads with  precipitation


[10/23/2025 3:42 PM] dagfinn_01993
Im sure it was anomaly, but i manually changed the weather to clear 1 and dont seem to be hit with rads so I dunno what's up 🤣


[10/23/2025 4:26 PM] lastdragonhorn
Is the mod list file on Nexus the same version as Wabbajack? WJ claims 0.5.8 while Nexus claims 0.5.7.7. I ask 'cause my Wabbajack is bugged and won't show any modlists at all, including Anomaly, I was partially downloading it when this started


[10/23/2025 5:12 PM] lastdragonhorn
Well that's great, downloading through the file gets me an error


[10/23/2025 5:29 PM] shalto
how do we save character presets in the looksmenu?


[10/23/2025 5:50 PM] toastonrye
My understanding is yes, that's what I've done. I have my 130 gb download folder still, plus the 130 gb unpacked mod folder.


[10/23/2025 6:14 PM] shalto
has anyone made robots in the mod pack yet?


[10/23/2025 8:01 PM] tarduq
hey im relatively new to fallout modding, this list looks the best visually so im here to check it out


[10/23/2025 8:15 PM] mynt_the_derg
never made em in vanilla, couldnt stick around in f04 before some big mod related game breaking bug occured, or got bored.


[10/23/2025 8:15 PM] mynt_the_derg
Never got to that dlc


[10/23/2025 10:20 PM] shalto
ah. does the presets option for looks menu work for you?


[10/23/2025 10:24 PM] mynt_the_derg
I uh, have no idea what that means


[10/23/2025 10:25 PM] shalto
one of the mods in the list is called looksmenu it lets you save presets for characters.


[10/23/2025 11:37 PM] tangledupforever
Is there an explanation for the "Warning: Radioactive" message. Walking around Lexington and then boom, dead in 10 seconds from radiation. Happened a few times.


[10/23/2025 11:53 PM] yami_ger
Did ya equip ya gasmask wheb you got the warning


[10/23/2025 11:55 PM] tangledupforever
I tried that the first time and the potassium iodide the second time


[10/24/2025 12:29 AM] yotsuhirasaka
I'm working on a really dumb companion mod for this modpack but im looking into making it more elaborate than probably necessary. 
Like, lacing your own food for buffs then getting poisoned or addicted.


[10/24/2025 2:43 AM] isalty.
Can you make it so every note you read doesn’t pop back up on your screen like you just got a special weapon


[10/24/2025 2:46 AM] dagfinn_01993
I saw this video from a year ago about Anomaly and I was curious what mod is this at 5:51? The watch thing. https://youtu.be/RxqJ4kdfQfU?si=7giEbrHO4klLM3fb

So i just found its the Foretrex....question is how does one get it


[10/24/2025 3:41 AM] isalty.
Am I supposed to be able to change the damage of a weapon in the workbench? I can click any of the damage increases for free.


[10/24/2025 3:42 AM] isalty.
Same with the threaded barrel lol, it says I need rank 2 gunsmithery but I can just put it on for free


[10/24/2025 5:54 AM] lateralus9290
Yes, certain guns have it, but honestly it's not that useful, unless you aim center mass. Any headshot on human size targets is going to kill most enemies with 1 bullet.


[10/24/2025 6:12 AM] seregonofcatarina
if they don't use power armor or good helmets


[10/24/2025 6:19 AM] seregonofcatarina
bethesda announced anniversary edition for fo4. is it going to be like skyrim's ae ?


[10/24/2025 6:19 AM] seregonofcatarina
should I block the writing for main game


[10/24/2025 6:27 AM] kregond
I tried LEO for the first time and stacked 4 Jakob's (100% ballistic damage and -50% mag size) and one Instigating on a M72 gauss rifle, the stacked -50% mag size somehow make it never ending with infinite mag size (I would expect one ammo size which could be paired with defiant). Now I have a broken as hell weapon. LEO might not be a good mod with this modlist, make weapons sometimes easily broken. There's also anti-tank and barret with heavy weight but even fully modded could not even match a base M72's damage.


[10/24/2025 6:29 AM] kregond
And for some reasons, my sneak mult is 20x sth, is that normal?


[10/24/2025 6:53 AM] lateralus9290
Well, you shouldn't be trying to use pistols against power armor anyway. I have high powered rifle for that and 4x+ sneak dmg. I've not seen anyone with a power armor that can take one headshot with it.


[10/24/2025 7:01 AM] seregonofcatarina
I'm using a shoulder mounted m2 for power armors


[10/24/2025 7:08 AM] lateralus9290
I keep throwing them away as they are broken now. Their dmg should be corrected in 0.6


[10/24/2025 7:36 AM] yami_ger
Yes


[10/24/2025 9:34 AM] deafguy1996
does anyone know why i cant get the enbseries fallout 4 zip through wabbajack?

Checking


[10/24/2025 11:28 AM] tiburse
I believe so, I wouldnt re-add it till we know why it was removed.  Might have been a conflict issue but I am unsure as that was before my time.


[10/24/2025 11:30 AM] tiburse

[10/24/2025 12:47 PM] dagfinn_01993
by pressing the number you faveourited it too


[10/24/2025 12:54 PM] deafguy1996
I mean like the weapon wheel that you can select


[10/24/2025 12:55 PM] deafguy1996

[10/24/2025 1:34 PM] deafguy1996
How do you quick change the filters?


[10/24/2025 1:36 PM] deafguy1996
The gas mask one


[10/24/2025 1:39 PM] wolfhound301
press H and pick in the menu, at least that's what I got so far


[10/24/2025 1:39 PM] wolfhound301
also anyone perhaps got the screenshot of all the keybinds in the game (default)


[10/24/2025 1:39 PM] wolfhound301
I'm having a hard time figuring out how to put the gasmask on, used to be T if I'm not mistaken


[10/24/2025 1:40 PM] deafguy1996
Ooh i wonder how i can change that h keybind to the mouse button that would save me so much time lol


[10/24/2025 1:40 PM] wolfhound301
probably in the mcm menu


[10/24/2025 1:40 PM] deafguy1996
Yeah but winch one im trying to figure that out lol


[10/24/2025 1:41 PM] wolfhound301
gameplay > wheel menu


[10/24/2025 1:41 PM] deafguy1996
Thanks man


[10/24/2025 1:42 PM] wolfhound301
np I just saw it too xD


[10/24/2025 1:42 PM] deafguy1996
Huh i dont see that in gameplay section of mcm


[10/24/2025 1:42 PM] wolfhound301
also I found hotkey manager there


[10/24/2025 1:43 PM] wolfhound301
oh sorry > user interface


[10/24/2025 1:44 PM] deafguy1996

:8276_Cool_Finger_Guns:


[10/24/2025 1:46 PM] deafguy1996
Yeah its much better on a mouse button tbh really, but next is the slo mo button that is a not a good location being on G lol


[10/24/2025 1:46 PM] wolfhound301
100%, that's in hotkey manager, just scroll down you will see it


[10/24/2025 1:46 PM] deafguy1996
In mod config?


[10/24/2025 1:47 PM] wolfhound301
mcm > user interface > hotkey manager, below wheel menu


[10/24/2025 1:48 PM] deafguy1996
I think the slo mo is vafs redux


[10/24/2025 1:48 PM] wolfhound301
yep, it was set to g, switched back to Q


[10/24/2025 1:50 PM] deafguy1996
Its all good now


[10/24/2025 1:52 PM] shalto
I just changed the setting to auto swap the filter incase i forget


[10/24/2025 2:00 PM] sk1ntf1re
Uhh, is there a way to disable getting rads from environment? Like its cloudy and i am getting ingested rads from not having mask


[10/24/2025 2:00 PM] sk1ntf1re
I guess its a core mod so maybe i cant disable


[10/24/2025 2:00 PM] dagfinn_01993
i changed the weather manually on the mcm and it seemed to fix it


[10/24/2025 2:01 PM] dagfinn_01993
press 7 on the num key and if it says vanilla clear go into the mcm and change the weather to any of the other clear options


[10/24/2025 2:02 PM] sk1ntf1re
Ohh i know of that but wondering if i can completely disable the rads from weather


[10/24/2025 2:02 PM] dagfinn_01993
probably not cause that would render gas masks mod obsolete


[10/24/2025 2:03 PM] dagfinn_01993
talking of gas mask anyone know how many variations of gas mask are in this list?


[10/24/2025 2:03 PM] sk1ntf1re
There is a holotape that can disable gas masks


[10/24/2025 2:03 PM] sk1ntf1re
But ill see if i can find something in mcm


[10/24/2025 2:04 PM] sk1ntf1re
Maybe create a new save before


[10/24/2025 2:17 PM] tiburse
it is


[10/24/2025 2:17 PM] tiburse
Most of the mod keybinds can be found in the hotkeymanager if not go to the actual mod page in MCM and you should be able to change it. I know my entire key setup is changed

Vanilla - been around since the OG fallout games


[10/24/2025 3:23 PM] tiburse
I believe it is baked into the mask for the resist

get out!  i didnt even realise that was a thing.  well tbh ive never really paid attention to the resistences before since vanilla is too easy.

Haha yeah, you generally get poison damage from the "bug type" enemies. But you're basically god by the time you encounter them and it'll mostly be their base damage that really impacts you

whats the deal with the main story? the notes show that the player isnt nate/nora but the whole shaun story line still exists.


[10/24/2025 4:10 PM] tiburse
Main story is part of fo4. no real way to change it due to scripting issues the way its in the game.


[10/24/2025 4:10 PM] tiburse
You can get mods that bypass it however


[10/24/2025 4:12 PM] yotsuhirasaka
link


[10/24/2025 4:25 PM] tiburse
Would be things like Silent protagonist. As we do not support as we wouldnt be able to assist with finding and adding mods to the list. You can check in User Modded Anomaly however.


[10/24/2025 4:33 PM] thomasthesiegeengine
I feel like I'm having a schizo moment but is the normal movement speed (not sprinting) supposed to be slow?


[10/24/2025 4:34 PM] tiburse
do you have an armor plate on?


[10/24/2025 4:36 PM] thomasthesiegeengine
No, I do have cesium cold, but I had that before and I swear I was walking at a normal speed


[10/24/2025 4:37 PM] thomasthesiegeengine
I'm also overtired and fatigued now


[10/24/2025 4:37 PM] thomasthesiegeengine
I can sprint just fine


[10/24/2025 4:40 PM] thomasthesiegeengine
maybe I just fatfingered a slow walk key?


[10/24/2025 4:45 PM] thomasthesiegeengine
actually even when I've unequipped everything it still says armor plate broken?


[10/24/2025 4:46 PM] jimmy.the.fish
Well caps lock is usually the toggle auto run key. If you haven't changed that binding, pressing it should put you back at normal running speed


[10/24/2025 4:47 PM] thomasthesiegeengine

[10/24/2025 5:30 PM] mynt_the_derg
Armor plates are their own thing, gotta use a new one from the Aid menu


[10/24/2025 5:30 PM] mynt_the_derg
or iirc the hotkey


[10/24/2025 8:35 PM] shalto
is it worth leveling strength for carry weight if i'm not gonna use any melee weapons?


[10/24/2025 8:41 PM] yotsuhirasaka
yes


[10/24/2025 8:51 PM] shalto
just wanted to make sure. i'm still trying to figure out how i wanna build my character. i know i plan to go in power armor but i also wanna stealth. and i do like being a loot goblin so carry weight will be nice

anyone else have an issue where there's a bunch of effects that are "Unnamed?" it's either the effect itself is "unnamed" or in some cases, like ibuprofen, it has several effects but all the descriptions are "unnamed"

[10/25/2025 4:21 PM] kregond
I'd say no, each strength add carry weight by 5 and 10 robustness add 10 iirc. And there are perks that add carry weight by 20 or 50, so you would pick them if you want carry weight. and you will find bags that add carryweight for 50 early and 100 later.


[10/25/2025 4:22 PM] kregond
It's the HOTC mod, default F for butcher, rebind that key to sth else, like B.


[10/25/2025 4:23 PM] kregond

yeah got into a fight with 3 of them after asking that. i found them near the atoms cats area, trying to get to where i can use power armor without having to do any major quest, curently trying to figure out how to make my screen not go pitch black when using a gas mask. i cant see a thing even during the day.


[10/25/2025 4:33 PM] yotsuhirasaka
I haven't played much with the newest Update/with Gas Masks of the Wasteland (IN THIS MODPACK, played tons with GMoW on my own), I can look into it over this week.

I have a question: as soon as I leave the vault and head toward Concord, my FPS drops a lot in some cases. My setup is: i5-13400F, 32 GB RAM, 5060 Ti 16 GB. It doesn’t seem like I should have any problems running at 60 FPS in 1080p.


[10/25/2025 5:20 PM] dagfinn_01993
is there a way to work out armor resistence? cause looking at the resistence on the gear  i currently have its  2, 1 , 1, 2, 60 on the armor pieces 20 on the backpack, 15 on the under armor 1 on the hat but on the bottom of my pipboy it only shows a 32 dmg res

hey does anyone know where i can manually download the files for this pack im missing 26 mods


[10/26/2025 4:47 AM] kregond
Just pick some tatos from diamond city or any farm then plant them on a place with only tatos or no crops, since vanilla settlement can't calculate multiple crops production correctly, not sure if it's fixed here. Tatos really make survival eating trivial, they might do sth about that next update


[10/26/2025 4:48 AM] kregond
There are bugs and some features or mods I don't like in this modlist, but overall I enjoy it very much, I think the devs would love to hear your feedback if you have some suggestions. There's a subchanel for that.

is the only way of  curing periodic rads debuff by visiting a dr? i was suffering with high level where i kept stumbling around, only doc nearby was bethany......situated in a rad field....make it make sense. so i got her to cure me only to be given yet another debuff but not as sever by the constant +1 to rads is driving me insane cause i know itll get to the severe stage eventually


[10/26/2025 9:40 AM] roggietheonly
Bro prolly died in the vault to a roach and quit lmao


[10/26/2025 9:42 AM] tiburse
✋ I did after smoking a roach does that count


[10/26/2025 9:44 AM] roggietheonly
You’re dealing with a high IRA, which you can check with the Rad Boy device you start with in your inventory, essentially you’ve ingested something irradiated and it’s killing you from the inside out. You can get rid of it by using the stim that starts with CD. I don’t remember the full acronym but it’s got a P and an R in there somewhere, and looks like a yellow stim. You have to have your weapon away for it to work though!


[10/26/2025 9:44 AM] tiburse
Ive only played modded FO4 since June. Came from modding ARK and Starfield. Nomad Streik and Soverign tought me a shit ton about doing this sort of thing. Ended up becoming a beta tester as I break things in the weirdest way.

Lmfaoo I got super high and installed this modpack one night, didn’t really remember in the morning. Woke up the next day like “did I install mods in fallout last night?” Loaded it up and was NOT expecting such an intense setup but I’m loving it. Have no idea how I got it working while stoned out of my gourd 😂


[10/26/2025 9:51 AM] dagfinn_01993
my radboy is showing 96 and im only taking +1 rads atm but they are indeed statcking up and i know the CD item removes the radition but does it actually cure the disease?


[10/26/2025 9:51 AM] roggietheonly
Stanley gave me a fuckin heart attack lmfao


[10/26/2025 9:52 AM] roggietheonly
What diseases you got?


[10/26/2025 9:53 AM] dagfinn_01993
because of the IRA im getting Periodic light rads (+1 rad every few in game mins) which is obviously a result of taking rad damage (which i recived from the dr being situated in a rad pool)


[10/26/2025 9:54 AM] roggietheonly
I think the CD or alcohol should take care of it


[10/26/2025 9:55 AM] dagfinn_01993
like i said would that clear up the disease or just remove the rads? ive used CD a couple of times but its only dropped the rads level down but it was soon regained with the periodic rads.


[10/26/2025 9:57 AM] roggietheonly
You’re confusing me a bit, as far as I know the periodic rads isn’t a disease, but IRA, which the CD/alcohol should clear? Perhaps you’ve run into something I haven’t encountered yet. I’ve only barely made it to Cambridge


[10/26/2025 9:58 AM] roggietheonly
You have you weapon away for awhile after using the CD?


[10/26/2025 10:00 AM] dagfinn_01993
let me try to clear it up.


[10/26/2025 10:05 AM] dagfinn_01993
I took to long putting on a gas mask so i ingested too much rads and it caused me to keep falling over every few seconds (it was a debuff called weak bones) i used my entire of stock of CD which didnt help it at all it decreased the IRA bar on the left of my screen. i eventually make it to Dr Beth to heal my radiation problems and it did it removed the weak bones Debuff but because she lives on a pool of rads i ingested some and was hit immediatly with another debuff (periodic light rads) and ive used a couple of the ira removing meds but its not removing the debuff (periodic light rads) so ive got an ever increasing IRA bar


[10/26/2025 10:11 AM] roggietheonly
I could definitely be wrong on this, as I'm still learning the pack, but there's two types of radiation, the normal fallout rads visible on that bar on the left and IRA, visible through the rad boy. I think normal rads are cleared with potassium Iodide. The Periodic radiation damage you're receiving is normal rads as far as I can tell, but it's caused by IRA. if you've got radiation poisoning you're probably dealing with both. that's about as much as I know on the subject. if it's more complicated than that, then I don't know enough to help ya lol.

dude radiation poisoning does suck ass, I started over from my first character because I burned through all my supplies after taking a heavy dose in concord. Radiation storm swept through while I was dealing with the deathclaw and I had two or three cases of cesium cold and the falling down one, so I could barely move. was stuck in sanctuary with no supplies


[10/26/2025 10:20 AM] dagfinn_01993
ayye that exactly what happened to me but i managed to deal with the falling over until i reached the doc but then her location is just fucking stupid smdh


[10/26/2025 10:22 AM] roggietheonly
it's been so long since I played fallout originally I don't remember where anything is and I like it that way lmao so no doc yet, haven't found one. I thing one of my legs were zeroed out too! I mean basically zero movement speed lmfao


[10/26/2025 10:23 AM] roggietheonly

is 10 mm ammo not craftable?


[10/26/2025 5:34 PM] rampage4920
You have to make the schematic, then make the schematic for the ammo workbench (these both cost "caps").
Then in the ammo bench, craft casings (10mm) and primer (heavy pistol/large pistol). Then you can make 10mm with gunpowder


[10/26/2025 5:35 PM] roggietheonly
no I figured it out, I was looking in the ECO menu for crafting ammo and 10mm isn't there so I got concerned


[10/26/2025 5:38 PM] rampage4920
Nice, good luck with the 10mm lol


[10/26/2025 5:50 PM] mynt_the_derg
yeah you need the ammo schem from one of the workbenches, which sacrifices a fair bit. ~100 rounds or so iirc

cleansing tonic is supposed to be under main in chem station right


[10/26/2025 8:42 PM] .avia
dont see it, mod is missing then?


[10/26/2025 8:43 PM] shalto
not sure, but apparently 293 caps doesnt cover the cost to get rad treatment from the doc in diamond city


[10/26/2025 9:14 PM] .avia
cleansing tonic doesnt show up in my chem station :/ am i missing a recipe or something?


[10/26/2025 9:14 PM] .avia
game is lowkey unplayable without it


[10/26/2025 9:20 PM] rampage4920
Some docs supply it. not sure about crafting


[10/26/2025 9:32 PM] shalto
game crashed on me and i dont rememeber if i saved or not, time to find out


[10/26/2025 10:46 PM] mynt_the_derg
Probably not a high enough crafting skill.


[10/26/2025 10:46 PM] mynt_the_derg
go see a doc.


[10/26/2025 11:51 PM] slaytoven.
youll need 300 caps, cheaper than the tonic


[10/27/2025 12:07 AM] dustywilder

[10/27/2025 12:07 AM] dustywilder

How do you turn off this annoying save feature?


[10/27/2025 12:08 AM] dustywilder
I'm all for hardcore gameplay but that is a redline in the sand for me.

how compatible are content expansion mods like diamond city expansion into the modlist? was disappointed to see near vanilla diamond city when i got there


[10/27/2025 2:48 AM] manchild792
hey everyone, enjoy the modpack but i dont like how spongey the enemies are, does anyone know ho to adjust enemies global health or damage?


[10/27/2025 2:54 AM] mynt_the_derg
Aim for the head.


[10/27/2025 2:54 AM] mynt_the_derg
Or Torso, Or Get better weapons.


[10/27/2025 3:22 AM] slaytoven.
this pack is bullet sponge.exe, check out Scourge in the MCM and change the health values. dont go too far or all the enemines will be too soft


[10/27/2025 3:22 AM] manchild792
thank you


[10/27/2025 3:25 AM] slaytoven.
the synth zombie isnt balanced by mcm so keep that if mind when you change fallevil scourge values


[10/27/2025 3:25 AM] slaytoven.
i disabled that mod

The modlist has esp explorer??


[10/27/2025 6:09 AM] dagfinn_01993
I had an experience last night in sure it was a vanilla dungeon but the absolute underwhelming i felt was crazy. I was exploring fens sewer and following the holos and with the mod pack it makes dungeons unnerving so as ive got to the end to realise there's nothing there and I was back to the start just killed me.


[10/27/2025 6:10 AM] .avia
lmaoo fens sewer is creepy as shit too


[10/27/2025 6:47 AM] yami_ger
Yep

There is a perk LONGARM OF THE LAW and its says I get more VATS? I though this got rid of VATS altogether?


[10/27/2025 8:30 AM] riflepoet
also there is something goofy going on with equipping companions, the little green square in their inventory list and what they actually seem to be wearing is out of sync.


[10/27/2025 8:31 AM] dankkaneki
yo i just installed this thru wabbajack and it says its missing the "launch anomaly bat" file, even though i was able to find it manually. Pretty sure i didn't miss a step in the install guide


[10/27/2025 8:33 AM] riflepoet
happened to me too


[10/27/2025 8:33 AM] riflepoet
Just rerun wabba multiple times

Does PA provide immunity to low rads (since you are not wearing a gas mask technically), or do you need to invest heavily into rad resistance modifiaction? How does one go to the glowing sea?


[10/27/2025 11:50 AM] kregond
I think PA give you 1000 or 2000 (base on module) rad resist. Hazma Suit gives you 5000. I used hazma suit since I'm not playing a PA guy, and there are a lot of PA in the Glowing sea to grab back.


[10/27/2025 11:51 AM] kregond
Actaully if it's not heavy rad storm the 750 gasmask (P88 or Assault gasmask iirc) would suffice, which I think they might have typed the wrong numbers here

whats the differnece between mutfruit & wild mutfruit? & how do i find mutfruit? the crops i pick are wild


[10/27/2025 2:27 PM] mr.wolf
Wild mutfruit contains more IRAs  than regular ones ! And you can’t plant them ! So just try to find normal ones and then you can farm them

Pretty sure gray garden and diamond city have mutfruit to take for free


[10/27/2025 3:41 PM] mynt_the_derg
iirc gray garden may need you to actually do their quest.


[10/27/2025 3:41 PM] mynt_the_derg

Hi guys, is there any indicator for being sheltered? i just dont understand where i need to go if a storm hits -.- even if I`m in a house, it is instant death. do i need to enter a building, like with loadingscreen and stuff? Was currently at starlight drive in when a storm hit and being inside any building there didnt count as shelter

hey, someone knows what is the id for the bandages? im bleeding and dont have any. Or how to search the id of modded items

If you disable shadowboost in MO2 that should fix it

I'm worried it might be off by default which is sad, AFT's mod page says that a pop up should appear at the very start of the game asking you if you want the option to save them, I didn't see one

[10/28/2025 11:37 PM] roggietheonly
that would probably have something to do with your .ini settings


[10/28/2025 11:37 PM] roggietheonly
just a guess, maybe resolution is set wrong?


[10/28/2025 11:37 PM] dzactual
how do i get to where i can change that


[10/28/2025 11:41 PM] roggietheonly
close the game, open your file explorer, navigate to your game folder, I don't remember the exact path, but you should be able to find a beth.ini I think it's called. It's a text document you can open and change the initialization settings like resolution and stuff, take this with a grain of salt because the modpack might have it's own version of .ini settings? i think I remember something like that but I'm not sure. sorry if I'm not the most helpful


[10/28/2025 11:42 PM] roggietheonly
if you're using an ultrawide moniter you probably need to use one of the optional mods listed in MO2


[10/28/2025 11:43 PM] dzactual
Im on a normalish size screen


[10/28/2025 11:48 PM] roggietheonly
actually maybe don't take my advice on this one I'm haivng trouble finding the ini's myself assuming the modpack uses it's own

nvm I found it

[10/28/2025 11:52 PM] roggietheonly

[10/28/2025 11:55 PM] dzactual
nope

Is there a way to change the keybind for the enb from shift-numpad 1? Its one of my mouse buttons, and somewhat awkward if Im running from something and the menu pops up


[10/29/2025 5:14 PM] roggietheonly
I can now confirm that you do NOT get xp when you companions kill something if you do not also damage it


[10/29/2025 5:47 PM] salt69
Found an MT helmet, with an NVG attached (can modify it on the table for it to be up/down, or change it into a face shield). Is this one cosmetic? Tried binding nvg button, nothing.

Also, Christ almighty what a modpack. Day exploded.


[10/29/2025 5:49 PM] kregond
I think that's cosmetic, end up being my endgame helmet tho

hey guys quick question: if i try to replace the filter on my mask it doesnt let me and it just gives me the filter back after "consuming" it. Can anybody provide some insights on this?


[10/29/2025 7:34 PM] dankkaneki
it probably is replacing it, i had a hard time telling if my filters were being replaced at the start.
look at the hud in the top left while wearing a mask, if the filter part of the gas mask icon is blinking **red** i'm fairly certain that means its filtering the air and losing durability, while if it's **blue** I believe its not required to keep you safe, but is still losing durability

there's also a "x___" beside the filters to indicate how many filters you have left, and a % number on the other side to show how much of your filter remains


[10/29/2025 8:45 PM] mcdursy
alright thanks


[10/29/2025 8:46 PM] dankkaneki
np, and im not saying it isn't bugged, simply sharing what i have learned about that system


[10/29/2025 8:47 PM] mcdursy
yeah i just thought the red blinking means it's empty and the % is the condition of the gasmask itself haha


[10/29/2025 10:07 PM] fireend
is there a way to clean my mask? like clean the blood? because i have it all over my characters face and when i remove the mask the blood goes away too

New player a bit confused by IRA. People say to use Ca-DPTA or Vodka, but for some reason nothing I take seems to lower the value at all. It seems to go up due to rads/eating, but nothing I do can bring it down. Is this a bug?


[10/30/2025 12:13 AM] moon_snacks
Like the stat menu says it is doing something, but the values do not change at all


[10/30/2025 2:19 AM] dagfinn_01993
There's an aid item called gas mask wipe i think to clean the mask


[10/30/2025 2:20 AM] fireend
lol i didnt even think that thank you


[10/30/2025 2:21 AM] dagfinn_01993
Make sure you cleanse rads with Ca-dpta then use a cleansing tonic to clear the debuff...you have yo clear the rads first otherwise itll keep happening


[10/30/2025 2:24 AM] dagfinn_01993
Have you checked your ira levels with the rad boy?


[10/30/2025 2:44 AM] skadhwe
Shift-K is the default to wipe the gas mask i think

Hey guys I’m stuck on the “the wasteland is harsh and every choice counts” I don’t know how to progress through any help?


[10/30/2025 3:44 AM] salt69
What you can do also is open the radial wheel menu, H, and there should be an option "wipe  off mask".


[10/30/2025 10:12 AM] monetaryfx
Are you supposed to constantly be taking periodic light rads? Like 247


[10/30/2025 10:23 AM] yami_ger
do you have an gasmask and applied the mcm and where

Is there a way to stop maim's status symbols disappearing constantly (the effects are still there)


[10/30/2025 12:17 PM] lateralus9290
Never happened to me, but someone mentioned losing all the settlers in such an attack, so I placed several turrets there. But it makes sense. The tunnel is an 'outside' cell even though it looks like you are indoors.


[10/30/2025 12:34 PM] kregond
Had couple ghouls attack but they only attack from the upper floor, set a couple turrets at the edge targeting the center would get them real quick, so not a big problem. And I often set my companions home there so they would also engage, as essential guards. I still consider abandoned tunnel the best operation base.


[10/30/2025 12:36 PM] kregond
vertibirds are almost obsolete now that APC and boat are in the modlist, as well as the tunnels for sure


[10/30/2025 12:37 PM] kregond
I think you could only find those mine rats near olivia? part of the raiders pets

I use it for mobile storage of healing items, ammo and artillery

Use Ca-DPTA to remove rads and then cleansing tonic to remove light rads debuff

I always had those arti flares and minuteman flares and minuteman arti flares, but never used them lol. Frags are OP in the modlist, I would more ofthen use them or just shoot them. I think APC had a rather complete travel points over the map, I'd run from one point or just use the tunnels. Hardly used anything else. There's the leo mod of infinite AP out of combat, very helpful for running.


[10/30/2025 12:42 PM] rampage4920
I had to clear out a massive amount of Super mutants for a cleansing quest, chucked a nuclear artillery at the whole place and presto, cleared

Did you use scrapall


[10/30/2025 7:41 PM] zombieface1337
i think i did lol but that was before i even started rebuilding


[10/30/2025 7:42 PM] yotsuhirasaka
:shrug: Yeah. Same thing for me. Tried it without doing that and it worked fine *and* I couldn't scrap the new one, kinda weird.


[10/30/2025 7:42 PM] zombieface1337
lol oh well, ive made a little scrap bridge but it only goes half way


[10/30/2025 8:16 PM] roggietheonly
there's a vertibird you can just use like that?

scrapall? i've been doing it manually lol

do not use scrapall


[10/30/2025 8:24 PM] tiburse
it not only breaks rebuild AIO but it also clears several scripts that will cause mid/late game issues

You would have to check in xedit for the weapon tags. It shouldnt be. More than likely an FIS issue assigning the wrong icon.


[10/31/2025 3:18 PM] yotsuhirasaka
-# Sure one sec.


[10/31/2025 3:19 PM] tiburse
If it is tagged wrong open a support ticket with screenshots of it in xedit and in game with the wrong tag/icon. If not then its an issue with FIS and that is up to the mod author to correct.


[10/31/2025 3:19 PM] yotsuhirasaka
My guess is FIS


[10/31/2025 3:20 PM] .avia
same


[10/31/2025 3:21 PM] yotsuhirasaka
Complex Sorter is stupid 90% of the time, getting that final perfect sort takes way too much micromanagement and the simple tagging function just doesn't have the resources to tag stuff very well. 
In my experience it basically just means "It's a gun."


[10/31/2025 3:21 PM] tiburse
More than likely tbh


[10/31/2025 3:22 PM] tiburse
and yep thats normally the fafllback for it


[10/31/2025 3:24 PM] yotsuhirasaka
Looks normal, just FIS being goofy.


[10/31/2025 3:25 PM] yotsuhirasaka
Though I might look into more behavior in-game since it *looks like* it *could* also be something with the way Nova setup his WEAPs


[10/31/2025 3:29 PM] yotsuhirasaka
(For context I forgot Nova does 2-3 versions of each one for different purposes; Crafting, Leveled List, Cheaty Version; looks like one variant tags slightly differently, at least on mine. Could also be a Complex Sorter Quirk, so if I don't say anything more, it didn't matter.)

Fallout 4 Buggery dude it's a messed up resolution. 
Sometimes can be fixed by reinstalling the modpack through Wabba but otherwise try setting it to Windowed then back to Full/Borderless (I'm super tired, can't remember which is the default with this modpack).


[10/31/2025 5:19 PM] yotsuhirasaka
*Alternatively* there's a weird non-standard resolution you can set to that fixes it immediately but it's some weird thing like 2166x1336 or something so I cannot remember nor recommend it.

[11/1/2025 9:45 AM] dagfinn_01993
have you got clean filters for the gas mask?


[11/1/2025 9:46 AM] skykinaniwalker
yeah i have 11


[11/1/2025 9:46 AM] skykinaniwalker
wait do i have to put them in manually? omg


[11/1/2025 10:06 AM] skykinaniwalker
now i feel muchos stupido...


[11/1/2025 10:22 AM] gibonez
I ingested some rads how do I lose that


[11/1/2025 10:49 AM] gibonez
Am absolutely loving sanctuary. All the new locations rock


[11/1/2025 10:50 AM] gibonez
What's wrong with explosives though


[11/1/2025 10:50 AM] gibonez
Indoors they kill you so easily even when not even in the same floor


[11/1/2025 11:03 AM] skykinaniwalker
there are some meds who cure u of that i think


[11/1/2025 11:18 AM] dagfinn_01993
Its a health item called C-DPAT or something like that


[11/1/2025 11:33 AM] gibonez
That only lowers my overall radiation I am taking continuous rads from food I ha previously ingested


[11/1/2025 12:12 PM] gibonez
Yah think it might be a big just taking I constant rads


[11/1/2025 12:12 PM] gibonez
Doesn't go away


[11/1/2025 12:38 PM] gibonez
ima find alchohol and just start chugging it


[11/1/2025 1:44 PM] dagfinn_01993
Ooh you got rad poisoning.. you need a cleansing tonic


[11/1/2025 1:44 PM] gibonez
What's the closest doctor


[11/1/2025 1:45 PM] dagfinn_01993
Where you at?


[11/1/2025 1:45 PM] gibonez
To sanctuary


[11/1/2025 1:45 PM] dagfinn_01993
Ummm its Dr Beth next to arc jet building


[11/1/2025 1:46 PM] dagfinn_01993
Go during the day because at night she sleeps in her hut located above a radiated pool


[11/1/2025 1:48 PM] gibonez
I'll try to make the trip


[11/1/2025 1:50 PM] dagfinn_01993
Have you been given the weak bones debuff from rads yet?


[11/1/2025 1:51 PM] dagfinn_01993
I managed to make it from end of concord to her and was falling over every 30 seconds because of weak bones.. you'll make it

How getting ready for a ‘Fallout New Vegas’ video game festival...
People in the town of Goodsprings, a town roughly 40 miles southwest of Las Vegas, had to evacuate or shelter-in-place on Tuesday after a box of dynamite was found in a shed.

[11/1/2025 5:49 PM] tiburse
It really is


[11/1/2025 5:49 PM] tiburse
are you launching it from the MO2 that is located in the folder that you downloaded the modpack to?


[11/1/2025 5:51 PM] andysmith27
I'm pretty sure that's what I did. Is it a zip file normally?


[11/1/2025 5:52 PM] andysmith27
I'm redownloading it now I will check that out and get back to you when everything is finished


[11/1/2025 7:30 PM] d2icarus
This might be a dumb question but can I safely delete all the mods in the downloads folder after the modpack has been fully installed?


[11/1/2025 7:42 PM] toastonrye
Yes but it will make updating the modlist in the future potentially longer. If you have the downloads it only downloads changes


[11/1/2025 7:43 PM] d2icarus
Appreciate that.


[11/1/2025 9:33 PM] gibonez
is there a console command i can type to get rid of all radiation but more importantly ira ?


[11/1/2025 9:33 PM] gibonez
i fall down every 3 seconds so making the trip to diamond city is tough


[11/1/2025 9:41 PM] dankkaneki
[ help "Cleansing Tonic" 4 ] without brackets in the console, just give yourself one. 
imo, there should be one in sanctuary because its VERY easy to get radiation poisoning and its very NOT easy to get a tonic early on, even without stumbling every 20s


[11/1/2025 9:42 PM] gibonez
thanks


[11/1/2025 9:42 PM] gibonez

theoretically how would i go about manually editing the hotkeys in the game. Where are hotkeys for the modpack stored


[11/2/2025 12:14 AM] yami_ger
Some are mcm menu others like junpoubg are chbaged via vanilla


[11/2/2025 1:03 AM] gibonez
Oooo the story teller companion wonder if he gives a permanent perk if I keep him along


[11/2/2025 1:05 AM] gibonez
I'm specifically looking for the vats command so I can have both vans and vats

I went on a 3 hour journey through there, found a random settlement, leveled up like 8 times and left with myself and all my companions loaded to the gills with junk and ammo. It was fantastic

do i have to supply ammo to my followers or do they have unlimited when i give them weapon xyz


[11/2/2025 6:24 AM] kregond
using AFT (pressing 3 on them by default) could set them to have infinite ammo, otherwise default they work like vanilla, only their default weapon has infinite ammo. there's AFT read me note in your note, or check mod page.

[11/2/2025 6:31 AM] troutymate
Man, the start is so brutal. How do yall get enogh ammo to survive? haha


[11/2/2025 6:35 AM] skykinaniwalker
i managed it by cycling you cant just use the weapon u want u have to use the one u have ammo for and dont sleep on grenades u get alot of baseball grenades pretty easy and early just take out groups with nades to save ammo.


[11/2/2025 6:36 AM] troutymate
Yeah, fair. It's just taking me like 15 shots to kill a mole rat haha. Raiders I can put down in 2-3 shots, 1 if I headshot from stealth. But the ghoul/zombies and mole rats etc are just eating the hell out of my ammo


[11/2/2025 6:37 AM] skykinaniwalker
shotguns one hit them use the shotgun ammo for critters and stuff and the other pew pews for humans


[11/2/2025 6:37 AM] troutymate
Yeah, copy. I'll try that haha

for the sewers under concord where do i find the ID is it behind the master lock


[11/2/2025 8:30 AM] iamencoded
Also another question, when talking to companions, why sometimes is there no option to trade equipment, it almost brings up dialogue only options?


[11/2/2025 8:42 AM] dankkaneki
can't help with the ID card but the dialogue bug seems to be part of the next gen update (?) i get that bug sometimes on my own modlist


[11/2/2025 8:42 AM] iamencoded
Ah that is fair, can be infuriating when you are trying to offload junk lol


[11/2/2025 8:43 AM] dankkaneki
fs, just hit the option to stop talking and try talking with em again, and it should fix itself


[11/2/2025 8:44 AM] dankkaneki
give them to me for safe keeping ill trade them up for you 💯


[11/2/2025 8:44 AM] troutymate
Random question. I can supposedly craft ammo due to my backstory. But I cant find it in the chem bench? Is there another perk I need or something?


[11/2/2025 8:48 AM] dankkaneki
completely unrelated to this question, but for your damage also go for headshots. I've been able to 1 hit kill everything except the deathclaw in concord and the defective synths


[11/2/2025 8:48 AM] dankkaneki
body shots seem to do like 15% of your headshot damage


[11/2/2025 8:48 AM] troutymate
Yeah, I tend to aim for the head. Literally the only thing I am struggling to kill is mutated shit haha


[11/2/2025 8:49 AM] quack_117
Just a question if anyone is able to answer this, can you craft **cleansing tonic** cuz I keep getting rad poisoning :<


[11/2/2025 8:49 AM] iamencoded
What us the blue skull icon, i assume its some sort of concussion, its in the bottom left of the ui


[11/2/2025 8:50 AM] dankkaneki
i think it means you're in shock? its just a general indicator of injury as far as i can tell


[11/2/2025 8:50 AM] dankkaneki
take some ibuprofen and u will probably be fine 👍


[11/2/2025 8:54 AM] dankkaneki
i think you can, but you need a very high medicine level? I'm only like 4-5 hrs in my save and i havent been able to find *any* cleansing tonic.


[11/2/2025 8:55 AM] quack_117
Yep ik the feeling :Cool_Finger_Guns_Crying:


[11/2/2025 8:56 AM] dankkaneki
If it doesn't affect your experience, you can always cheat one in for yourself. I did bc I got tired of falling over every 15s on my way to diamond city lmfao


[11/2/2025 8:57 AM] quack_117
How do you cheat one in i'm recently got back into fallout again so im a bit rusty...


[11/2/2025 8:58 AM] dankkaneki

i am just in concord now ill take a look


[11/2/2025 9:04 AM] roggietheonly
I’m almost lvl 40 and I haven’t found one, I just make my way to a doctor. You can set up a doctor in sanctuary


[11/2/2025 9:05 AM] dankkaneki
oh sorry i forgot the second part lmfao

after you do that, the console will list items with their Object ID in parentheses that contain the words in the quotation marks in the "help" command.
to give yourself the item use the command [ player.additem <ObjectID> <Quantity> ]


[11/2/2025 9:07 AM] dankkaneki
yeah, but thats not feasible early on, i wasn't able to find a doctor either until i was about 100 feet away from the diamond city main gate


[11/2/2025 9:08 AM] dankkaneki
granted, i basically went straight from concord to diamond city, so i didn't search all too hard


[11/2/2025 9:09 AM] roggietheonly
Agreed! My first run I restarted because I had really bad rad poisoning, this one I was SUPER careful with rads until I made it somewhere with a doctor


[11/2/2025 9:09 AM] quack_117
It's totally ok dude, I've done it but it still say's "Missing ObjectID"


[11/2/2025 9:10 AM] dankkaneki
when you do the [ help "Cleansing Tonic" 4 ] command you should get some text above where you are currently typing


[11/2/2025 9:10 AM] quack_117
Yep got the ID which is the words right?


[11/2/2025 9:10 AM] dankkaneki
gimme a sec and i will show you with in game screenshot


[11/2/2025 9:11 AM] dankkaneki
no, its the string of numbers & text


[11/2/2025 9:11 AM] dankkaneki
something like 0EF7AC


[11/2/2025 9:11 AM] quack_117
Ok tysm btw


[11/2/2025 9:11 AM] dankkaneki
in parentheses


[11/2/2025 9:12 AM] quack_117
You really didn't have to go this far for me but genuinely I really thank you for what u doing!


[11/2/2025 9:12 AM] dankkaneki
no worries g


[11/2/2025 9:13 AM] quack_117

fast travel? since when can you do that in anomoly?


[11/2/2025 4:50 PM] toastonrye
like the abandoned tunnels settlement, its basically fast travel


[11/2/2025 4:51 PM] toastonrye
it's west of the castle, middle of the road between a bunch of 2 story building/townhouses


[11/2/2025 4:51 PM] dagfinn_01993
oh yeah i know about that. but outside the tec building down from the apc theres a manhole surrounded by little fences that allows you to open and close but not enter


[11/2/2025 4:53 PM] toastonrye
oh I thought you were looking for the concord abandoned tunnel entrance. I just assume the manhole by vaulttec offices is a joke. Like when you open a door and its a brick wall behind

The castle one? just walk along the road to main entrance backward, the road where you test the arti. If you have APC the APC travel point to the Castle is right next to the manhole.


[11/2/2025 7:02 PM] kregond
This is a weird companion, I don't like his voice and constant blabbering so I dump him just after I met him. You could check the codex mod to see if he has a perk or quest, which I hardly listened anyway, similar to the added radios.

Can survival be turned off so I don't need food and water? I don't mind survival games when it comes to needs like that just wish I didn't have to go back and forth into the pipboy to see it


[11/3/2025 1:46 AM] skykinaniwalker
right at the start when u leave  the cryo pod in vault 111 u are being asked wich difficulty setting u wanna use, survival, ''recomended for anomly'' aka modified survival and two other things, thats ur best bet to turn it off by choosing one of the bottom options but i never used any of those only the recomended setting


[11/3/2025 2:44 AM] yami_ger
Wasnt that setting for the gasmasks


[11/3/2025 2:45 AM] skykinaniwalker
oh i thought that was general difficulty settings, nvm then

Every time I play fallout 4 I am reminded of how much Bethesda regressed when it came to complexity. I miss switching ammo types I miss DT


[11/3/2025 4:56 AM] slapmypoodle
Downloaded and got it all setup and it seems to run fine. Only issue is that the game starts and runs in the top left corner. Once I get to the character creation it goes full screen but my ui and the area I can move my mouse is stuck to that corner still.


[11/3/2025 5:34 AM] maskeyato
will my game be fucked when this update drops or will it be a seprate thing

On a long journey one might encoubter a giabt metal bird where one can maybe find his son where destinies interwine. 
Another can be found deep in the east where the man of time once rised but bettyed by their own flesh and with an cat in their heart.
The last can be found near an missguided ship where nothibg is like it looks like where many grouos can meet.

Hey with fallout 4 getting the anniversary update soon i’m curious if the proper way to turn Steam updates off is to go to the fallout app ID manifest file and change it to read only


[11/3/2025 7:51 AM] d2icarus
"The update will not be free, and it will be implemented as a paid upgrade rather than a free patch."


[11/3/2025 7:52 AM] d2icarus
On the one hand, good. I ain't gotta worry about it fucking up my game. On the other hand, fuck your greed Bethesda.

yeah i dont know what the policy regarding bethesda on this discord is so i will spare the admins the trouble of banning me, by not ranting...but yeah, they forced us to buy that upgrade for skyrim and now for fallout, knowing that they target the mod community with that and thats pretty shitty behavior...I leave it at that xd

Hi


[11/3/2025 11:36 AM] yotsuhirasaka
Not sure if this is the exact one you're thinking of but a very common one I experience is the result of an **incomplete animation** or **incomplete conversation**

The latter is way more annoying and probable with tons of followers so I had to cut my squad in half


[11/3/2025 11:36 AM] yotsuhirasaka
For the former if you just go to like any workbench and use it, it should fix it.


[11/3/2025 11:38 AM] yotsuhirasaka
Even rarer is when one of them breaks door opening which can low-key softlock you, fix for that in my experience is to close the game and start it back up- and if its still broken you just lost progress.

[11/3/2025 12:12 PM] d2icarus
It's neither of those. Literally for no reason sometimes my Tab, Space and Mouse 1 just stop working while in any in-game menu (crafting menu, inventory menus, pip-boy, settlement building menu, main menu) and when that happens the space bar stops working completely (character can't jump anymore) and so far, the only solution I've found is quit to desktop and relaunch. Pretty annoying cuz it happens about 5-10 minutes into a game.


[11/3/2025 12:15 PM] yotsuhirasaka
:Thonk: Definitely think I've had that before, if it pops up again I'll process troubleshooting it.

I thought it was a linux issue so ive tried a bunch of crap


[11/3/2025 1:22 PM] rbmkz
1. disable controller inputs, even though I have no controllers
2. Enable background mouse in ini
3. disable vsync and use a 3rd party tool to lock fps to 60fps
4. alter protontricks to force game to run in embedded panel


[11/3/2025 1:22 PM] rbmkz
nothing seems to work


[11/3/2025 1:23 PM] rbmkz
If Im in a menu and it doesnt work, I can alt tab, click on another program to change focus, then tab back into game and suddenly the inputs work again


[11/3/2025 1:23 PM] rbmkz
But as soon as I leave the menu/pipboy it will reoccur

I think in the chat couple others have the same issue, iirc someone submitted a support ticket for it. I had the same issue, and the only fix I found is the same as yours, exit and relaunch. And as for the HOTC hotkey you could change them in the MCM menu, the default is F which is the same as the activation.


[11/3/2025 2:49 PM] thedonkey_king
Do you know how to get rid of it? I’ve been taking CA-DTPA Injectors and I still have those effects. Also how do I know my IRA levels?


[11/3/2025 3:37 PM] yotsuhirasaka
Probably have Radiation Poisoning, see a doctor
Use the Rad Boy Item to see

'coc' or use unlimited survival mode mod


[11/3/2025 11:05 PM] kordigoth
i suppose both


[11/3/2025 11:17 PM] rbmkz
Use "centre on cell"/coc command as said above if you plan to just use it a few times when the game bugs out or you forget to save or something. I use this method bc I like to stick to survival but sometimes the game sucks and you don't want to waste time.


[11/3/2025 11:17 PM] rbmkz
The other, if you plan on needing to fast travel a lot, then you are best just downloading a mod that removes the restriction in survival


[11/4/2025 12:58 AM] mynt_the_derg
there are also Methods ingame (apc and The Abandoned tunnels) for longdistance travel instead of running

[11/4/2025 3:58 AM] jax11111

[11/4/2025 4:51 AM] jax11111
nvm figured it out


[11/4/2025 6:40 AM] kregond
same with fast travel, use 'unlimited survival mode' mod, or just use cigs to save, they are too many cigs sitting around and it basically turns into infinite quicksave.


[11/4/2025 6:41 AM] kregond
yeah, they are part of the gunners gears, most proper gunner outpost should have a commander who wears one. Or you goto the renegade base to buy them, which is west most of the map and below nuka transit center. They are neutral gunners, I almost shot all of them when I first met them

[11/4/2025 12:30 PM] kregond
You have to manually switch it, by cliking the filter under aid, as for hotkey should be shift f2 or f3, shift+k for wipe, check mcm settings for the gasmask mod under survival. You may want to set auto change filter there, but it kinda break immersion. I hate and love this system the same time, some tuning would be nice, instead of instantly kill the player while a companion standing healthy in a radstorm in glowing sea smiling at you naked.

Fallout 4 – Patch Notes/New Features
Creations Menu: A new in-game Creations menu has been added, making it easier than ever to discover, download and enjoy content from professional developers and passionate enthusiasts alike.
Gameplay & Performance 
VATS Accuracy: VATS hit chances are now consistent across platforms and no longer drop to 0% or show incorrect values. Targeting enemies through walls without the Penetrator perk is no longer possible.
NPC Visual Creations: Fixed stuttering and hitching caused by Creations that edit NPC visuals. Performance is improved when using such Creations.
Stability & Crashes 
BNET Connectivity: Better handling when there is a Bethesda.net outage
Crafting Station Crash: Interacting with crafting stations or the workshop on ultrawide monitors no longer causes crashes.
Ultrawide & Super Ultrawide Support
UI & HUD Scaling: UI elements, HUD backgrounds, and item previews now scale correctly for 21:9 and 32:9 aspect ratios. Menus, quest updates, tutorials, workshops, and inspected objects are no longer stretched or squished.
Pip-Boy Map: Players can now place markers, fast travel, and pan the map to the right side in the Pip-Boy when using ultrawide resolutions.
Save Preview Images: Save preview images are now letterboxed to avoid looking squished on ultrawide monitors.
Miscellaneous
Resolution Detection: Autodetect now sets supported display resolutions, preventing crashes on launch.


[11/4/2025 4:38 PM] robocoyote
finally they fixed that next gen bug

Curie is a doctor on the run which only cost 50 caps instead (she cure all rads and heal all injure like normal doc but can't heal rad poisioning since that's another mod thing), both of them are kinda breaking the balance of healing.

[11/4/2025 11:52 PM] brunson5653
it is possible to stop the game when i am in the menu ? like i have change Fallsoul in the MCM but nothing change


[11/4/2025 11:58 PM] yotsuhirasaka
Fallsouls is a pretty big script, I'd start by saving and reloading after changing any settings to make sure it's affecting it or not;
If that doesn't work I'd recommend starting a new game and removing FallSoul from the list (shouldn't break anything to my knowledge, technically be a performance+) 
Since if you don't want Fallsoul in Inventory there's not too much point in having it


[11/5/2025 12:23 AM] brunson5653
all right i gonna try ty ! 🙂

[11/5/2025 9:26 AM] yotsuhirasaka
-# (Though that's not universal, pretty sure some stuff is at 15, some at 20, etc.)


[11/5/2025 9:30 AM] d2icarus
If it helps, remember that the HK G11 and P90 are production firearms in the Fallout lore. Which means that anything made up until at least 1990 can exist within the Fallout lore.


[11/5/2025 9:32 AM] d2icarus
Although realistically it'd probably be closer to 1995 since the HK G11 prototyping was cancelled in 1990 and while they were pretty close to a finished product that could go into production, they still needed probably at least another year or two to finish the prototyping phase and move into production. Then give it another year or two to become available on the US Market. So 1995 is a more "realistic" cut-off date for what can and can't be considered "lore-friendly"


[11/5/2025 9:33 AM] yotsuhirasaka
-# If I go for a Lore-Friendly-ish setup I just round up to 2001


[11/5/2025 9:33 AM] d2icarus
Which is funny because we know Glock (the company) exists in the Fallout lore because they made the Glock 86 Plasma Pistol and since the cutoff date for "lore-friendly" is 1990 at the absolute earliest and the Gen 2 Glock pistols went into production in 1988, it'd be completely lore friendly to have Gen 2 Glocks in Fallout lol


[11/5/2025 9:36 AM] d2icarus
Yeah that's pretty close to my cut-off date. I generally go for anything pre-2000.

They want to destroy all technology or hoard it for themselves is that I always understood.

find any knife (e.g. bowie knife, machete, they have diff efficiency), then aim at the dead hunt and press f (change hotkey to others, say 'b', in MCM-Hunters of the Commonwealth) similar with robots, but with a working bloctorch you craft on utility workbench

Radiation is a killer, you will see a lot of complaints about it in this sub early on


[11/5/2025 7:55 PM] eighthcontrast
I don’t even know what enb is lol I’m half lost with the modding stuff.


[11/5/2025 7:55 PM] rbmkz
Think of it as Minecraft shaders


[11/5/2025 7:55 PM] rbmkz
vanilla is no shaders, an enb is with shaders on


[11/5/2025 7:55 PM] eighthcontrast
Does that work as an in game tweak?


[11/5/2025 7:56 PM] rbmkz
Its an injected process from a 3rd party tool. Generally just something put in the game files, along with the palette that can be modified.


[11/5/2025 7:56 PM] rbmkz
Theres also an ingame menu for it, yes


[11/5/2025 7:56 PM] eighthcontrast
Interesting, I definitely want to give it a go.


[11/5/2025 7:57 PM] eighthcontrast
Also, radiation is a killer how? Just new enemies, storms or what?


[11/5/2025 7:57 PM] rbmkz
This modlist has taken the "You need to wear a mask if you are going anywhere outside" from the Metro series whole hog


[11/5/2025 7:58 PM] rbmkz
So theres filter management, fixing your mask if it breaks, cleaning blood off of it if you get shot


[11/5/2025 7:58 PM] rbmkz
etc.


[11/5/2025 7:58 PM] eighthcontrast

Honestly I like it, I think I’m just going to throw myself into the deep end of it


[11/5/2025 7:58 PM] rbmkz
Its less problematic than you think. Its all connected to binded hotkeys so you can literally just press a key to do it


[11/5/2025 7:59 PM] rbmkz
Only gets annoying with how quickly you get rads if you forget to swap the filter when the current one hits 0%


[11/5/2025 7:59 PM] rbmkz
but it has its own HUD feature, so thats just me bitchin lol


[11/5/2025 8:00 PM] rbmkz
Drumlin diner has a doctor who clears all your rads for 300 caps if you end up getting turbo radded AIDS


[11/5/2025 8:00 PM] rbmkz
Thats probably the most salient advice for someone new


[11/5/2025 8:01 PM] rbmkz
Going to a doctor if you have more than 4 bars of IRA will honestly be more cost-effective than trying to heal it yourself


[11/6/2025 2:51 AM] dagfinn_01993
I like dying over and over again to scenarios I've completed 10x over in the past 😮‍💨 took me about 6 tries to kill Ahab & then all the other bots & rust devils leading to the exit of the fort hagen station. I felt so damn accomplished afterwards.

[11/6/2025 3:48 AM] streikeizer
To be fair the guide covers the most pressing systems in. But there are more systems in you dont really have to interact with if you dont want to. The gasmasks where the latest addon. And I've personally not played alot with them myself.


[11/6/2025 3:50 AM] streikeizer
IRA is the deal breaker for most new players 100% but if you play 1 or 2 characters with them you should get the hang of it.


[11/6/2025 3:52 AM] streikeizer
Maybe its worth giving it a good look at some point again. But its kinda one of the keystones of the survival experience at this point.


[11/6/2025 3:57 AM] streikeizer
You can disable the RADS plugin to lessen the radioactive areas a bit to ease the pain early on. No clue if it breaks the list at this point tho 🤞.

I want fallout to become less arcadey and more immerisve, also challenging (so yeah also rewarding). and ANOM is great on that.

👍

[11/6/2025 4:13 AM] keplarion
The TLDR on IRA is that there are two separate versions of radiation that you can get.

See of it as radiation that you can easily wash off and radiation that's embedded in your clothing etc.
You can see normal rads at the bottom left of your screen, your IRA level can be checked using the Rad-Boy.
If your IRA reaches 1000, you die. So make sure that doesn't happen.

Using a CA-DTPA (radaway) reduces both normal rads and IRA so whenever the Rad-Boy indicates that you're in a dangerous level, use one.
High IRA can lead to radiation poisoning and manyother kinds of sickness, if you end up getting sick a doctor can patch you up or you need to buy a cleansing tonic.


[11/6/2025 4:15 AM] kregond
I suggest refreshing beverage for IRA and x-111 for rads in terms of price and effectiveness. I personally bind rad-boy to "-" and pressing them constantly. It'd be great if it has a custom UI also showing near the rad UI.

[11/6/2025 4:15 AM] keplarion
Oh good suggestion, I'll look into that once I get back on.


[11/6/2025 4:16 AM] keplarion
A custom UI next to the existing bar would be nice, I know it confused me at the start but with a little searching you can figure it out


[11/6/2025 4:17 AM] kregond
yeah, later in game it doesn't matter as I know rad-boy and hardly get fk by rad and IRA as I got the hang of it


[11/6/2025 4:18 AM] kregond
just to new players, to reduce the early game frustration a bit and keep them playing, to enjoy this great list


[11/6/2025 4:21 AM] keplarion
Oh absolutely


[11/6/2025 4:22 AM] keplarion
My first time dealing with IRA I saved and ended up in a 30 second death loop so I can understand it being confusing to somebody new


[11/6/2025 4:25 AM] streikeizer
If there is anything I would personally like to focus on more its gonna be the mid-late game.

Question, my helmet says it has NVG's down, how do i activate them?


[11/6/2025 5:43 AM] yami_ger
I think on these helmets its cosmetic


[11/6/2025 5:44 AM] yami_ger
How about more patrols of certain factors or harder enemies or dome hsrd requirements for certain things


[11/6/2025 5:59 AM] dagfinn_01993
Your best option would be to find a similar style helmet without NVGs and locate a pair of usable NVGs and put them on together. May look a bit Jankey but does the trick


[11/6/2025 6:10 AM] kregond
FAST MT helmet (banadana version perferable) with hacked visors from westek and p-88 mask (or other face only masks) which only covers the face, also with LEO it's 3 slot for legendary. They clip nicely together. And yeah, the FAST-MT helmet NVG is probably cosmetic


[11/6/2025 6:29 AM] eighthcontrast
Is there anything this modpack removes from the main mechanics of the game to make it more difficult?

[11/6/2025 11:36 AM] yotsuhirasaka
Use Higher Caliber weapons, early and honestly throughout most the game I'd recommend like the Lever Action


[11/6/2025 11:36 AM] yotsuhirasaka
Shotguns can also be a good all-around choice


[11/6/2025 11:36 AM] dzactual
i can blast them in the head with a shotgun and the turn around as put one in the chest and i die instantly


[11/6/2025 11:38 AM] yotsuhirasaka

This might be kind of a dumb/noob question but I have zero experience with ENB. If I wanted to use a different ENB than what's in the modpack how do I make that work? Just install it via MO2 and activate it like any other mod?


[11/6/2025 3:32 PM] toastonrye
I look at Concord as a way to prepare the player for the mindset, they aren't the indestructible protagonist they are used to. It's a different experience. Also nothing says you have to actually beat Concord first, Ive been to diamond city and Corvega before the deathclaw fight in Concord.


[11/6/2025 3:59 PM] lil_noctifer

I cant even get out of the vault i die from radiation


[11/6/2025 3:59 PM] silentmo_53179
Where I am currently at with it in my playthrough into the late late level 100 endgame is that Concord becomes an obstacle to my cultivation of civilization and cornfarms due to the respawns. (So I dummied the oppressive concord plugin and used the Concord Restoration Project and settlement mod)

I understand there will be a version with the Concord underground Church as a settlement soon but since you leaned so hard into Concord being a hellhole it would be cathartic to have an option to be able to Conquer Concord as a sort of resource sink to work towards.


[11/6/2025 4:02 PM] silentmo_53179
I like the idea of Pushing out from Sanctuary to red rocket to concord as the TRUE sanctuary settlement 

And I also like the idea of fighting  a war for it lol


[11/6/2025 4:03 PM] toastonrye

[11/6/2025 4:53 PM] silentmo_53179
MCM menu somewhere has an option to disable Instant death for players on headshots. I say keep it on for enemies.

I think its fine because a shot to the head will usually kill you anyways with or without that little script running to ensure it lol.

Also wear helmet


[11/6/2025 4:54 PM] silentmo_53179

[11/6/2025 4:54 PM] eighthcontrast
Yeah I need to find a helmet I guess. I tried concord and that went south 456 times, so I went for vault 111 govt and that’s also gone south 4738 times lol


[11/6/2025 4:55 PM] silentmo_53179

Just because it’s the beginning stuff?


[11/6/2025 4:56 PM] silentmo_53179
no they made it that way lol

You can get a lot of early levels through scroungin and crafting EXP

or you can hit the add level console command to jumpstart to like level 10 to give yourself a chance lol


[11/6/2025 4:57 PM] silentmo_53179
Level 1 you are literally an NPC
Level 100 is closer to classic Fo4 levels of god tier protag


[11/6/2025 4:57 PM] eighthcontrast
Yeah sounds like I need to spend some time around sanctuary then I suppose lol


[11/6/2025 6:05 PM] toastonrye
I've had success levelling around Sanctuary in the NW corner of the map, putting perks into the medcine tree for extra damage against raiders and scavenging tree for zombies is extremely helpful early game in my opinion


[11/6/2025 6:24 PM] eighthcontrast
Yeah I did finally have luck with killing all of the raiders through the first bit of the govt vault 111 lol

[11/6/2025 6:43 PM] d2icarus
Honestly I was able to clear the main area of Concord where all the raiders are with just the three or four grenades you get from the vault and Sanctuary. But then again maybe I just got stupid lucky.


[11/6/2025 6:44 PM] d2icarus
Grenades are retardedly OP in this pack


[11/6/2025 6:44 PM] walkmahone
I haven't really used grenades because the blast radius is ridiculously large. I've killed myself a few times


[11/6/2025 6:45 PM] eighthcontrast
Nah the crazy part is I tried to get through concord for like an hour with just the pistol. Finally killed them all to hear one more guy in the hardware shop upstairs. Walk up there and get my intestines removed in one shot by a shotgun lmao

hello all. i keep getting a Steam error code when i try to Launch From MO2. i do not understand what i am doing wrong. i believe i installed files correctly and made anivirus exceptions for fsve and MO2. do i need to make more ? if so what do i need to exempt ?


[11/7/2025 9:34 AM] eighthcontrast
i asked him to fix me up, not rads. I got my IRA to 1 and had him fix me. I still have 6 things hitting me like brittle bones, lethium lung, cesium cold, etc.


[11/7/2025 9:42 AM] eighthcontrast
is there something else i need to do to get rid of those things?


[11/7/2025 9:51 AM] j4eyun
Thanks for the heads up! Is there any way to tell the difference between revolvers and pistols (like by the type of receiver)? I feel like there are far fewer revolvers than pistols, so I'd imagine there would be weapons that look like pistols but are actually revolvers. Looking at the mod page, I don't see any such distinction.


[11/7/2025 9:53 AM] dagfinn_01993
I believe there is 2 different forms of rads. Try get doc to cure rads and to clear ira yourself you need a cleansing tonic


[11/7/2025 9:55 AM] dagfinn_01993
If im ever that bad I always just get a rad purge and full heal from the doc in that order

anyone know where the 2nd hideout is after concord?


[11/7/2025 10:30 AM] keplarion
If you’re referring to the quest that specifies “part 1”


[11/7/2025 10:30 AM] keplarion
There’s no part 2, the mod was never expanded upon


[11/7/2025 10:30 AM] keplarion
There are however other hideouts from different mods such as the water pump station thingie


[11/7/2025 10:51 AM] streikeizer
Im not sure myself tbh. I know the desert Eagle tags as revolver. And the ones that look lik revolvers also do. There are not alot of revolvers yeah.


[11/7/2025 10:53 AM] dagfinn_01993
Water pump station thingie? Umm where is this?


[11/7/2025 10:55 AM] keplarion
It’s located near the atom cats garage.

It's heartbreaking to see such an amazing project end this way but I'm proud of the team for everything they've accomplished in its lifespan and for making the choices they need to for their own lives. Many of us will be upset by this decision but it must happen to preserve the legacy of Anomaly.

I haven't played much but I enjoyed the list and the idea behind it so much and I'm so thankful to the team that made it happen. Wishing you all good luck and good fortune in your future endeavors.

right-click Fallout 4, go to updates, switch to 'only when I launch the game'. Hope it will get bypassed by Mod Organiser 2. Or close/go offline on steam before launching the modpack

it is not separate, it is forced on everyone


[11/7/2025 3:09 PM] nomad5157
The modlist will probably not be downloadable after the update until wabbajack pushes an update


[11/7/2025 3:09 PM] eighthcontrast
I’m actually mad dude the timing of this is incredible lol.


[11/7/2025 3:10 PM] nomad5157
If you download the list before the update you can play as we store a older copy of the game in our install.


[11/7/2025 3:11 PM] menumorutziscrapusaumenuthotep
Oh. That's interesting


[11/7/2025 3:12 PM] nomad5157
So long as you do it before the 10th, if not then you will have issues downloading


[11/7/2025 3:12 PM] d2icarus
Well, as fucked up as it is, one good thing coming out of this anniversary update is there'll (hopefully) split the nexus game categories like when they did the same thing for Skyrim so you won't have to worry if the 8 year old mod still works with the current version of the game lol


[11/7/2025 3:13 PM] d2icarus
The downside is the FO4 modding community was never as strong as the Skyrim modding community so the list of mods that'll get ported/updated is probably gonna be a lot slimmer.

Would it be possible to  copy the files elsewhere for safe keeping if I wanted to swap to a different modlist? If so what files need copying?


[11/7/2025 4:11 PM] kregond
Just read the annoucements, I gotta say I'm lucky to have played the last version of Anomly and unlucky to witness it being the last version, and shame on bethesda btw, it's hard to understand sometime why companies like this could've made great games like TES and FO. Great jobs devs, and good luck on your future works!


[11/7/2025 4:20 PM] rbmkz
By its nature, Wabbajack installs are separated from your normal game.


[11/7/2025 4:21 PM] rbmkz
Both in its installation location being different from fo4 common path, and virtualizing all the mods through MO2


[11/7/2025 4:21 PM] rbmkz
You should be able to install as many modlists as you want without overlap

[11/8/2025 12:19 AM] johnny_bucking
like how do i remove the radiation constantly battering me


[11/8/2025 12:47 AM] walkmahone
You could console yourself some cleansing tonics to heal your body. Then I would read how the radiation system works on the Damn Apocalypse Nexus so you don't get overwhelmed by it again. Then you could craft or console in a hazmat suit in order to shield you from environmental radiation. Try not to wear it in combat situations cause you don't want to damage it.


[11/8/2025 12:58 AM] therhythmz
You cannot remove damn apocalypse because it ties into the Anomaly radiation system that gives you IRAs along with RADs. There's plenty of locations in and around sanctuary that may provide a way to source a gas mask. One of those used by raiders works fine for the time being.

Quick question after reading Nomad's announcement - once the new FO4 update releases, will it automatically break a currently installed Fallout Anomaly save/download? Basically, can I keep playing after the update hits?


[11/8/2025 10:49 AM] .skeetin
Think i found my own answer (download list prior to the 10th).


[11/8/2025 10:49 AM] .skeetin

you can disable auto-updates and play trough mo2 after you install the modpack i guess


[11/8/2025 10:59 AM] menumorutziscrapusaumenuthotep
Apparently not. Look at former dev nomads message above


[11/8/2025 11:04 AM] .skeetin
Saw something about an older install of the game being available. Know where I could find that?


[11/8/2025 11:05 AM] menumorutziscrapusaumenuthotep
Yeah, the one available now. The FO4 update will be on the 10th, just install the modpack before then


[11/8/2025 11:05 AM] .skeetin
So even if I have the modpack installed and I am playing it now, I need to reinstall?


[11/8/2025 11:11 AM] .skeetin
Or could I just backup my current game files and replace post-update?


[11/8/2025 11:33 AM] johnny_bucking
well the problem is that i dont want to wear a gas mask, i mean i like the immersion but im sick of the gas mask wipe and or filter


[11/8/2025 11:33 AM] therhythmz
You can turn off gas mask shaders. That way they have no visual effects


[11/8/2025 11:34 AM] therhythmz
The filter thing is a bit tricky tho. I dont think that can be removed.


[11/8/2025 11:38 AM] zackketchup65_55670

where might i do that at


[11/8/2025 11:51 AM] therhythmz
In the MCM menu. I dont remember where and my pc is broken right now so i cannot check. Be careful of what you touch, there's tons of tweaks that depend on specific mod configurations and altering them might break the cohesion of the modpack. But the gas mask shaders you can disable.


[11/8/2025 11:52 AM] johnny_bucking
i got it! thank you


[11/8/2025 12:06 PM] therhythmz
Dont worry man! I hope you have fun.

Check the mcm for keybindings if the options isnt working


[11/8/2025 12:25 PM] .skeetin
Can anyone confirm this? If I backup my game files prior to 10th can I continue playing the modpack?


[11/8/2025 12:43 PM] kregond
in the gasmask mcm, you could set filter to auto change, so you only need to worry about having some filters in inventory and no longer care about changing them


[11/8/2025 12:45 PM] kregond
I think the modlist use a stock game, which is basically a copy of the base game, so I'd assume if you install correctly now, and never launch steam fallout (disable auto update), I think you should be able to keep playing it. I'm no expert on wabbajack so my understanding could be wrong tho


[11/8/2025 1:09 PM] ph4nt0mbr
Yeah, for some reason isnt saving. Every time I close mcm see through scopes go back to the default config. Is there a way to separate the granade button to the heavy attack button?


[11/8/2025 2:19 PM] ph4nt0mbr
Ok, it works throught the Settings holotape

[11/8/2025 3:47 PM] yotsuhirasaka
Depends on a variety of things.


[11/8/2025 3:49 PM] yotsuhirasaka
- Tactical Reload isn't on the Modlist, installing it could cause Crashes, and installing a mod that does have it could cause crashes.
- AMMO records; if it uses Munitions or Vanilla/DLC Ammunition, it should be out of the box compatible. If it uses it's own AMMO included in the mod; then you'd have to rerun the Munitions or True Damage ROBCO patch- and hopefully it doesn't break anything like it did for me.

1. I blew up a guy's leg once, [Live Dismemberment](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/16400) would actually require patching because it's *not* just a plug-and-play mod.
2. Can't say as I remember what level it starts spawning at, but you can craft one using the Weaponsmith workbench through a convoluted series of requirements. (See: Crafting Journal (Utility Workbench) and Engineering Workbench; Requires like 1-3 different perks)

Probably IRA. Use the Rad Boy to check if you have Radiation Poisoning; if so, see a doctor.

[11/8/2025 8:55 PM] yotsuhirasaka
Other way is a drinkable, occurs when you get a certain amount of Radiation (I think)

As suggested, it should be survival skill, if you have 50 survival most recipe would be unlocked, also there're perks under survival about cooking unlocking more recipes. I remebered never having a recipe for dog meat, but radstag can't remember

also, thermal visor is OP, there are a couple horror quests in this modlist, if you had thermal on, they no longer horror


[11/9/2025 12:39 PM] kregond
So for best exp, take those off or at least keep them off before you do these quests

Is t60 and tesla t60 PA 2 different armor sets or is the tesla a modded t60? I got a whole suit off on of the rust devils and some parts are tesla some are normal


[11/9/2025 1:07 PM] loafofbread324
does anybody know if there is the riot gear from nv in this pack?


[11/9/2025 1:11 PM] yotsuhirasaka
Not that I can see, but armors should be pretty plug and play as long as they aren't missing requirements.


[11/9/2025 1:12 PM] yotsuhirasaka
For Helmets you should use ECO to add the MAIM Helmet tag


[11/9/2025 1:12 PM] yotsuhirasaka

is it just dirty water and boiled water now not purified?

Hey guys, does anyone have a glitch that make the contrast go to shit when you put on a mask?


[11/9/2025 3:32 PM] yotsuhirasaka
Severe Desaturation, believe it's a feature though


[11/9/2025 3:32 PM] yotsuhirasaka
Not sure on how you can disable it besides the overlay


[11/9/2025 3:33 PM] yotsuhirasaka
Or it may also be an ENB Hotkey set to the same keybind to fake it
-# I don't think that's the case.


[11/9/2025 3:34 PM] ph4nt0mbr
but that only happen when I put the mask with the masks of the wasteland overlay, and couldn't find nothing to avoid it, except turn the mod off


[11/9/2025 3:38 PM] zackketchup65_55670
also when i put the mask with goggles on the filter on top left of my screen flashes read and says its at a 100%\

Wow Steam is the arbiter of game updates in your library, that's a shame


[11/9/2025 3:58 PM] .bobson
Oh ok so there is a scheduled update workaround by only allowing updates from 12AM to 12AM apparently will effectively allow no automatic updates


[11/9/2025 4:26 PM] zackketchup65_55670
how do i turn dirty water to purified?

designed way is water bench via craft journal via engineer bench, but a cheaty way is to use the vault 88 water fountain and fill bottles. Or you have lead belly (rank 3 remove all rads or IRA from food) and drink dirty water like purified water

Can you set that per-game? Or does that setting encompass every game in your library


[11/9/2025 11:34 PM] .bobson
every game, lol.. so you would have to manually update everything I guess

[11/9/2025 11:37 PM] .bobson
I'm curious if you could still launch games online without updating first, though... you may be forced to go offline from Steam in order to avoid updating F4


[11/9/2025 11:46 PM] walkmahone
you can set the appmanifest file to 'read only' and only launch the game in offline mode.

I am getting Effect penalties for a Small Plate even though I am using a Juggernaut Plate now. Is there a way to fix this? I hope it's not permanent. I applied the MAIM armor type mod to the small plate.


[11/10/2025 2:52 AM] .bobson
I tried resetting the Replaceable Armor Plates "button", but the debuff remains ... ugh. People have similar issues from 2024 and no reply on the nexus page

[11/10/2025 4:35 AM] frosty0898
Although for me I fixed it just by swapping to a fresh version of the same kind of plate


[11/10/2025 8:39 AM] toby_doomer
Hello, at the beginning i can choose between different presets. What are the differences? cant find anything about them.


[11/10/2025 9:24 AM] menumorutziscrapusaumenuthotep
idk either, i just went with Anomaly default and it's hardcore enough


[11/10/2025 9:31 AM] .bobson
I would just do this one as it's recommended


[11/10/2025 9:31 AM] kregond
I assume it is about the settings in MCM, I suggest use default or recommended like Only War said, if you have no clue about it


[11/10/2025 9:31 AM] .bobson
what do they mean by slot 56? in their mod order?


[11/10/2025 9:32 AM] .bobson
the game is rough to start out, but it makes it way more rewarding. Full disclosure, though, I got to the Power Armor on top of Concord, couldn't use it, and ran back for Sanctuary


[11/10/2025 9:32 AM] toby_doomer
extra question. Perk modern warfare allows you to craft weapons in weapon workbench but no recipes show up? is it like separate workbench?


[11/10/2025 9:33 AM] menumorutziscrapusaumenuthotep
equipped slot 56, that being the plate


[11/10/2025 9:33 AM] menumorutziscrapusaumenuthotep
take all equipment off to make sure slot 56 is unequipped


[11/10/2025 9:34 AM] .bobson
do you know where I can get the same type of plate? I only have Jug and medium right now

[11/10/2025 9:36 AM] kregond
I avoid those perks giving you gun recipes, for one you got all guns from loot or vendorss, two the mods in charge of the perk and crafting are saparate ones, and they sometimes cancel each use out. for example, a lot of ammo you could craft them without taking the perk. As for where to craft weapons, probably some bench you unlock via the engineering bench using craft journal

ooh apparently you can craft plates with armor smithing


[11/10/2025 9:38 AM] kregond
yeah, they are helpful early but later on I just dump all these plates loot or sell them, they are not totally worth it with the AP reduction and move speed reduction and you could have ballistic weave even on your scarf and legendaries even on your ring, in the end I had like 500 DR just wearing clothes, balance broken so to speak


[11/10/2025 9:39 AM] menumorutziscrapusaumenuthotep
true, they slowed me the fuck down


[11/10/2025 9:42 AM] kregond
yeah, for that slowness why wouldn't I wear PA instead, which is superior in defense anyway. but those plates are good for emergenceis


[11/10/2025 9:42 AM] menumorutziscrapusaumenuthotep
PA?

for the illness, heather is really helpful, she is a mobile vendor who sell you tea and drinks that cures almost anything except rad poisioning. she is somehow balance broken for this reason as well


[11/10/2025 9:46 AM] .bobson
you can't freely unequip them from the pipboy, I'm not sure how else to do it


[11/10/2025 9:46 AM] .bobson
other than using the mod reset button


[11/10/2025 9:47 AM] .bobson
what's weird is you can use plates even if naked

[11/10/2025 9:52 AM] kregond
Yeah they are pretty good, I think some mods add their durability so they really feels like PA, there are also some holotapes lying around (like police stations of military bases) for you to "upgrade" your PA skills (have 4 ranks iirc), after you unlock them via one of the 4 teachers, those are also saparate mods.

you could build air filter (not under special, but the ones could only built on dirt) in power-misc(iirc) but it is really expensive and cover only area of a house, I tried to cover all santuary house and depleted all of my fusion cores. But under the filtered area, you don't need no masks


[11/10/2025 12:52 PM] .bobson

I am hitting F2 and shift+F2 but toggling the widget doesn't show gas mask filter %. Can someone please tell me how to check your gas mask filter? I'm pretty sure that I died to RADS bar maxxing out, but it's not obvious that the filter is at 0%


[11/10/2025 1:07 PM] kregond
not the fog filter, it's called air filtration or sth. the fog filter doesn't do nothing afaik


[11/10/2025 1:08 PM] kregond
I don't remember clearly, but I had plenty of circutry, maybe you had little investment in salvage skills? it is an OP skill, and kinda broken if you reach 100 and double salvage perk.

The only thing they want you to "buy" is the creation club crap.

You can just ... not


[11/10/2025 6:13 PM] choowkee

[11/10/2025 6:14 PM] choowkee
The anniversary pacakge price does not diminish if you own all DLC


[11/10/2025 6:14 PM] choowkee
because the season pass and DLC are listed separately


[11/10/2025 6:15 PM] choowkee
so if you dont pay attention you can essentially re-buy the DLC


[11/10/2025 6:16 PM] d2icarus
If you already own the DLCs there's no reason to buy the season pass.


[11/10/2025 6:16 PM] d2icarus
And for the anniversary update, the update itself is free and applied automatically.


[11/10/2025 6:16 PM] d2icarus
The only thing you'd have to pay for, if you wanted to, is the creation club.

[11/10/2025 6:17 PM] choowkee
if you own all the DLC


[11/10/2025 6:17 PM] d2icarus
Yeah because the season pass is a seperate thing you can purchase.


[11/10/2025 6:18 PM] choowkee
which makes no sense


[11/10/2025 6:18 PM] choowkee
if you own all the DLC already.

[11/10/2025 6:18 PM] d2icarus
There's no reason to buy the season pass


[11/10/2025 6:18 PM] choowkee
...


[11/10/2025 6:18 PM] choowkee
correcty


[11/10/2025 6:19 PM] choowkee
so why is the season pass higlighted as avaialble for purchase in the bundle?


[11/10/2025 6:19 PM] choowkee
invididual DLC are greyed out


[11/10/2025 6:19 PM] d2icarus
Because it's something you *can* buy? You get nothing for buying it if you already have the DLCs tho.


[11/10/2025 6:21 PM] choowkee
yes which is why it makes no sense that Steam/Bethesda are not checking if you already own all the individual pieces of the DLC that are part of the season pass


[11/10/2025 6:21 PM] choowkee
its very simple, if I own all the DLC = remove the season pass from the package


[11/10/2025 6:22 PM] d2icarus
I mean, that's kind on you as a customer to make sure you're not buying stuff you don't need. It's not the stores fault if you go buy bread and then go buy a sandwhich making kit that has bread in it.


[11/10/2025 6:23 PM] choowkee
by that logic there shouldn't be any checks in place whatsoever


[11/10/2025 6:23 PM] choowkee
the other DLCs are marked as already owned


[11/10/2025 6:24 PM] choowkee
I choose to believe that Bethesda did that on purpose to bank on people not paying attention


[11/10/2025 6:24 PM] choowkee
but thats just me


[11/10/2025 6:43 PM] yotsuhirasaka
That's a Steam thing not even Bethesda


[11/10/2025 6:43 PM] yotsuhirasaka
Happens with like every bundle


[11/10/2025 6:43 PM] yotsuhirasaka
Also if you didn't buy a Season Pass entry but did buy everything it gives you


[11/10/2025 6:43 PM] yotsuhirasaka
etc


[11/10/2025 6:44 PM] yotsuhirasaka
Calm.


[11/10/2025 6:45 PM] yotsuhirasaka
It is depressing though that now we're modding across three game versions that aren't even like openly available (like in Steam or anything, ie: Project Zomboid)


[11/10/2025 6:45 PM] yotsuhirasaka
There's no strategic benefit to version 1.10.163 it's just a matter of Bethesda posthumously updating their own game for microtransactions (xoxo my favorite gamerslop)


[11/10/2025 6:46 PM] yotsuhirasaka
Which is also just as depressing with Skyrim. 
These updates meant for hype just kinda break the remnant community. Very pog.


[11/10/2025 7:06 PM] .bobson
I know it's not a big sneak attack monster, but the Service Pistol (Beretta 93R / 'Raffica') is awesome. I love it when burst weapons in games doesn't mean that you have to fire the same number of shots in every burst and is instead based on how long you hold down the trigger like in Helldivers (similar to Full auto guns)


[11/10/2025 7:06 PM] .bobson
too many games use "Call of Duty" bursting


[11/10/2025 7:31 PM] .bobson
Ok, so Legedary creatures don't usually have an observable inventory preview for me- but if you open the console or use the "Examine your prey" keybind to Show Inventory, then you can see the loot


[11/10/2025 8:47 PM] .bobson
I know this might be a stretch, but does Fitness/Robustness skills (or do the stats Strength or Endurance) play a factor at all in tiredness/overtired/insomnia? One of my biggest gripes for PZ was that I couldn't find a mod to make it so that more fit characters didn't get tired and die so quickly


[11/10/2025 8:56 PM] .bobson
Nevermind, I guess all of these stats indirectly affect how much these things impact you, since they're flat rates


[11/10/2025 9:01 PM] .bobson
I still have not found a small plate to try and get rid of me bugged debuff lol

[11/10/2025 11:33 PM] 0nil
Does anyone have a fix?


[11/11/2025 1:11 AM] walkmahone
Mama Murphy is naked? You mean she is in here undergarments, right? Can you post a pic of the "no foliage"?


[11/11/2025 1:29 AM] .bobson

I got lithium lung, i assume from radiation poisoning. How do i heal it? antibiotics didnt work and i cant find anything about it. Also is it possible to craft cleansing beverage to remove rad poisoning?


[11/11/2025 3:26 AM] toby_doomer
Something is broken, im getting rad poisoning but my IRA is 1, im in settlement with air purifier and im not getting any active rads


[11/11/2025 3:27 AM] toby_doomer
This whole rad rework is just annoying and a headache


[11/11/2025 3:32 AM] g00ch369
Hi, can somebody give me an hint why I can´t open the Pipboy using the xbox controller? I have OPT-Controller support activated in MO2. Everything else works fine. thx

Cleansing tonic


[11/11/2025 4:11 AM] 0nil
Sorry, the problem got worse. All the npcs lost their clothes and I couldn't interact with them. It was basically unplayable so I uninstalled


[11/11/2025 4:11 AM] 0nil
I'll reinstall later once I'm not annoyed at losing 20+ hours of progress


[11/11/2025 4:12 AM] 0nil
I didn't manage to get on but there were missing patches of grass/bushes all over, mainly around redrocket near sanctuary and around concord


[11/11/2025 4:39 AM] walkmahone
Search for "Sausages Method" It's the only way I got controller to work right.


[11/11/2025 4:47 AM] cbsgaming
hey im new to fallout 4 modpacks so how hardcore survival and how much dying we happen as i found the vanilla survival mode really easy after lvl 10


[11/11/2025 4:54 AM] kregond
Once you got rad poisioning due to high IRA, reducing it won't cure it, you either use cleansing tonic, not refreshing beverage which only reduce IRA, or go to a doctor and chose cure rads. And yes, most debuff are from high IRA, rad poisoning is one of them and second most annoying one, the most being stumbling plus move speed reduction.


[11/11/2025 4:55 AM] kregond
Use rad boy to keep your IRA in check, once it is no longer "safe" level, you have chance to get all these debuffs


[11/11/2025 4:57 AM] kregond
mama murphy in her undergarments is a known bug, with some NPC dueto gas mask equiping unequip their clothes. I somtetimes cound'nt interact but most of the time restart game will fix most problems, never had to reinstall, and even if you do you could keep your savefiles, they are under the folder somewhere, you backup and reinstall you won't lose even a minute

[11/11/2025 4:59 AM] kregond
very, expect you to die alot to alot of reasons early, but yeah, after a point it would be easy, but that is much later then lvl 10

[11/11/2025 8:08 AM] cbsgaming
so still hard and die a lot even after lvl 30+


[11/11/2025 8:47 AM] kregond
I think yeah, hard till around lvl 40, and suddenly very easy (technically still harder then vanilla but feel easy) around lvl 50. If you minmax a bits with INT like getting 10 early, skill points would be excess at around that point (so no need to minmax INT just for skill points), so max 100 on all skills and plenty perks (you could also reset perks since now you know which are useful and which not), and also you learned all the mechanics. I complaint this difficulty curve thing on a post, but still very fun, and much more fun then vanilla

Someone told me that the Desert Eagle is considered a .44 revolver, but I think that's incorrect. The Cylinder Specialist perk works fine with the .44 revolver, but not with the Desert Eagle. The Dismissive Detective trait promises a revolver but gives you the Desert Eagle instead, but don't be fooled.

and how is fallout 4 enhanced compared to anomaly?


[11/12/2025 4:59 AM] zrtec1
Well it's been long gone sadly. It had great loot drops. Had to take your time to think out your approach. It had horizon which I love the settlement system they had. Had a good variation of enemies, weapons, and armor but also not making the game feel really bloated with kitchen sink stuff. Very survival focused.


[11/12/2025 5:00 AM] shards2843
oh, so its gone? That's unfortunate


[11/12/2025 5:07 AM] shards2843
I'm enjoying anomaly right now, but to be honest some things are odd, like range on grenades is insane(considering blast also goes through the walls)


[11/12/2025 5:10 AM] zrtec1
Yeah was like 2022 era? It went under a different name. Like Horizon enhanced. 

There was also some other modpack that was in between that pack and this pack. Some other creator that had like 5 modpacks at once on wabbajack

If you need kellog you need to still do the nick the clockwork dih investigate cornflake's house quest then go to rice crispie's compound and he should spawn. I believe this also respawns a shitload of synths


[11/12/2025 9:02 AM] reb.uoh
Ik that, but why


[11/12/2025 9:02 AM] sgunstoppible
ive killed kellog did the whole brain thing and went saw virgil and killed the courser


[11/12/2025 9:02 AM] sgunstoppible
still nothing


[11/12/2025 9:02 AM] sgunstoppible
idk just cuz


[11/12/2025 9:04 AM] reb.uoh
Also fun fact, did you know that arkjet will infinitely spawn synths until the game crashes (until you push the button)

[11/12/2025 9:04 AM] sgunstoppible
what is it


[11/12/2025 9:04 AM] reb.uoh
If no then try find the quest in console and progress it manually


[11/12/2025 9:05 AM] reb.uoh
You should have a cheat terminal holotape on you


[11/12/2025 9:05 AM] sgunstoppible
i did tried that for ammo on this run bot no ammo ;-;


[11/12/2025 9:05 AM] sgunstoppible
ahhhhhhhh forgot about that


[11/12/2025 9:05 AM] reb.uoh
Probably too low of a level


[11/12/2025 9:06 AM] reb.uoh
If that doesn't work then try type "```help "name of quest" 4```"

Then progess using commands


[11/12/2025 9:07 AM] reb.uoh

[11/12/2025 9:07 AM] reb.uoh
You can use sqs <QuestID> to list all quest stages for that quest


[11/12/2025 9:10 AM] robocoyote
I had used esp menu to grab it but normally you’d just follow the bounty hunter quest line to get one


[11/12/2025 9:11 AM] reb.uoh
Do you have the mew free CC stuff?


[11/12/2025 9:12 AM] reb.uoh
If so then the radiant should start automatically


[11/12/2025 9:12 AM] reb.uoh
If no then you suck ig? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯


[11/12/2025 9:16 AM] riflepoet
so if the game breaks due to updates, how will I know? Will .5 MO still launch? As in can I continue playing waht I have currently installed?


[11/12/2025 9:25 AM] reb.uoh
The update shouldn't break the game but in the event it does you can always manually revert it


[11/12/2025 9:25 AM] reb.uoh
If you'd like i can give you commands


[11/12/2025 9:26 AM] riflepoet
Oh so it is only for future development?


[11/12/2025 9:27 AM] riflepoet
The master modder just didnt want to deal with teh next version but the old one will still work?


[11/12/2025 9:27 AM] riflepoet
also, my gas mask mechanic is clearly broken...


[11/12/2025 9:28 AM] riflepoet
I have a 0% to the left of the gas mask icon

i started a new save maybe that save was bugged i came out of the elevator fromthe roof and no one came to fight me


[11/12/2025 9:30 AM] riflepoet
I have a x6 to the right of the gas mask but the filter part of the icon is blinking


[11/12/2025 9:30 AM] riflepoet
how do I change filter? Can I do it from the pipboy or do I have to use the hotkey?


[11/12/2025 9:31 AM] riflepoet
I went into pipboy, clicked the filter, the icon to the right showed x5 for a sec, then changed back to x6


[11/12/2025 9:34 AM] reb.uoh
Basically yeah, bethesdick did really good with the update but also kinda fucked up some mods


[11/12/2025 9:34 AM] reb.uoh

The game *should* work but dont expect it to be perfect


[11/12/2025 9:41 AM] reb.uoh
Though i think f4se needs updated if you do


[11/12/2025 9:42 AM] riflepoet
Yes, I'd like to revert to something that I can play through to the end if possible


[11/12/2025 9:45 AM] reb.uoh
I would recommend asking others their experiences with the update because i have no idea if its broken or not


[11/12/2025 9:48 AM] riflepoet
You said commands?


[11/12/2025 9:49 AM] robocoyote

On steam it says it has a update available but it won’t start the update unless I launch or click update now. I have my settings to only update when launched.

[11/13/2025 3:21 AM] wintersrose2263
step 4 profit showing me downloaded files, to once installed open your install directory with outlines of files i dont see at all


[11/13/2025 4:04 AM] walkmahone
Did the list successfully install? Did wabbajack finish without an error?


[11/13/2025 4:59 AM] frosty0898
Also set the appmanifest_377160.acf to read only in properties menu. That will also help F4 from updating cuz sometimes steam likes to screw with the update settings


[11/13/2025 5:12 AM] cbsgaming
Anyone know if the hazmat is changed or does it have perma rad protection


[11/13/2025 6:27 AM] kevlar7897

[11/13/2025 6:55 AM] walkmahone
It's worked for me, but I haven't gone anywhere that overly radioactive. What do you mean by "perma rad"?


[11/13/2025 7:24 AM] cbsgaming
doesnt need filters like the gas mask


[11/13/2025 7:25 AM] walkmahone
it needs filters


[11/13/2025 7:25 AM] cbsgaming
even hazmat suit


[11/13/2025 7:27 AM] walkmahone
yes. They are really easy to craft or just collect them in the world. Just save all of your used ones and the ones you find on NPCs.

did you downgrade the game or updated or what language is your game


[11/13/2025 8:55 AM] darkbat88
its in english and the version is equal to or higher than 1.10.980.0 in the download folder


[11/13/2025 8:55 AM] darkbat88
but my game is 1.11.137.0


[11/13/2025 8:56 AM] darkbat88
re downloaded yesterday


[11/13/2025 8:56 AM] darkbat88
should i downgrade


[11/13/2025 8:57 AM] yami_ger
i say try to downgrade to pre anniversy addition they released a few days ago


[11/13/2025 8:57 AM] darkbat88
ok how to?


[11/13/2025 8:58 AM] kregond
hazmat has a rad resist of 5000 iirc, and could be worn with armors, and yeah it need filters, but every raider has a filter or a used one, very easy to accumulate

That first Concord run is *brutal*; not really sure how to help/describe it. Honestly from like a gameplay perspective it's kinda the filter to "see if ya have what it takes" in the Wasteland.

is there anywhere that I can find what the hud icons mean? specifically the ones which show up next to the soldier / body condition outline?


[11/13/2025 4:49 PM] dankkaneki
most if not all of the icons are tied to the mod MAIM


[11/13/2025 5:04 PM] _askman
those ones I think I have figured out, but there are some more which seem somehow related to what armour you're wearing that appear between the MAIM icons and the condition boy(?) icon


[11/13/2025 5:27 PM] yotsuhirasaka
I've seen it but not sure if it actually matters or if it's just the Condition Boy being funky,
If it does matter then it's likely Maim's interpretation of what limbs/parts are armored.

[11/14/2025 4:34 PM] kregond

[11/14/2025 4:35 PM] kregond
sleep, cigs, survival pack. the latter two are gifted to you in the box in vault 111 or red rocket irrc


[11/14/2025 4:36 PM] kregond
survival pak give you a hard save, cigs should be either an autosave or a quicksave


[11/14/2025 4:36 PM] darkbat88
oh thank you. and one more thing where is the mobile workbench? do i have to craft it? and how to get crosshair in 3rd person


[11/14/2025 4:38 PM] kregond
some mobile workbench are crafted using utility bench, you find one in the abandoned tunnel which you will find along the road from sanc to red rocket. If you mean a workbench that could be dropped and used at anytime, crosshair Idk, by default you don't have them


[11/14/2025 4:39 PM] darkbat88

manhole? i'm gonna check that out when i get to sanctuary bc i just left the vault. mind telling me what enemies are in there if you nearly died lol


[11/14/2025 5:54 PM] .bobson
There shouldn't be any for a while unless you're unlucky. I'm not sure what triggers it, I think it's because I built up Sanctuary so now my settlements are open to getting attacked


[11/14/2025 5:55 PM] .bobson
But there's a sheltered hideout in there and you're indoors so fully protected from radstorms whcih can appear day 0

I just have the basic one that produces dirty water. I forget where the Water Chip craft is located. Also it seems people are saying that the player has to manually activate the purifiers. It seems like you can't assign someone to pump purified water from some of the messages people have said here

[11/14/2025 7:38 PM] yotsuhirasaka
I think technically the maximum amount of debuffs would be every addiction (Tats, Psycho, Jet, Alcohol, Buffout; Don't think I missed any) All the Diseases, MAIM cripples, IRA effects, and Survival effects. Pretty sure you'd die from other stuff by the first few


[11/14/2025 7:38 PM] .bobson
I just meant the maladies from drinking dirty water and rad sickness

[11/14/2025 8:27 PM] komodo6474
Once you find covenant, you can use the APC to fast travel there when you need a doc, until you can add a doc to your settlement


[11/14/2025 8:27 PM] azyms
That's so useful


[11/14/2025 8:28 PM] azyms
I don't know what I would do without you telling me this stuff 😭


[11/14/2025 8:28 PM] azyms
I read the guide still but there is so much more to it aswell


[11/14/2025 8:28 PM] azyms
Does the APC require gas or oil or anything?


[11/14/2025 8:36 PM] komodo6474
Open mcm and change setting for no required gas and no chance of attacks if you want this


[11/14/2025 8:40 PM] komodo6474
One location of APC can visit is the farm that you are setting up which would be nice


[11/14/2025 8:45 PM] azyms
I will definitely do that BC I like being able to fast travel in fallout


[11/14/2025 8:46 PM] azyms
Yep that will be perfect. Also does the APC stay at a place that you travel it with to? Like if I traveled with it to my farm would it stay there until I used it travel again


[11/14/2025 8:49 PM] komodo6474
Yes APC stays there, once you unlock more tunnels you will be using the tunnels more later in the play through instead of the APC


[11/14/2025 8:50 PM] komodo6474
You will be able to travel to Covenant for doc and then travel back to farm once you find covenant

just that one error. Actually it's specifically this. Could not find a part of the path Could not find a part of the path 'G/modlistsFallout StalkerTEMP_BSA_FILES8856ae6b-eac8-4df1-969d-1426906d77b9texturesActorsCharacterFaceCustomizationDLCworkshop03.esm000042B4_d.DDS'

you could try download this depot: download_depot 377160 435880 366079256218893805      thats a command for steam to download a depot of fallout 4 DLCWorkshop03 game file

read the message above. it might be a bit hard to understand at first but after you read it all you will understand


[11/14/2025 11:22 PM] azyms
Wasteland Workshop DLC

download_depot 377160 435880 366079256218893805

Go to ..../Steam/steamapps/content/app_377160/ — this is where the downloaded files are located.

Move the files from each folder into the game’s main directory (do not move the folders themselves — only their contents).

And then try to install anomaly.


[11/14/2025 11:23 PM] chainassassin
I'll check it out. Figured it may have something to do with that. thanks

[11/14/2025 11:25 PM] sxulstice.
i reset the download i was downloading the list through the nexus file instead of using the one on wabba dont know if it makes a difference but we will see


[11/14/2025 11:25 PM] azyms
your not using wabbajack to download it?


[11/14/2025 11:26 PM] azyms

[11/14/2025 11:26 PM] azyms
it worked for me so thats strange


[11/14/2025 11:26 PM] sxulstice.
i am but i was using the modlist file from nexus instead of the one in wabba when u go to the game an stuff


[11/14/2025 11:26 PM] azyms

Also what version of fallout 4 do you have downloaded


[11/14/2025 11:30 PM] azyms
Next gen or anniversary


[11/14/2025 11:30 PM] chainassassin
using next gen


[11/14/2025 11:31 PM] azyms
Nice. It should work then


[11/14/2025 11:32 PM] azyms
The depot that you're are downloading is next gen files for fallout 4 that people use to downgrade their game from anniversary so idk but also your workshop file might be broken sooo we'll see if it works


[11/14/2025 11:35 PM] chainassassin
hmm it seems that since I'm missing dlc workshop03.esm, I'll actually need the downgrade file for the contraptions dlc


[11/14/2025 11:37 PM] azyms
What you could do is just get steam to verify fallout 4 files so you can get to anniversary edition then just downgrade with these depots to next gen BC idk the depot command for contraptions


[11/14/2025 11:38 PM] azyms
That's my only guess to try to get it to work


[11/14/2025 11:39 PM] azyms
But also if you are already on next gen version you shouldn't be having any issues with other game field that's why I only said the DLC workshop one to download


[11/14/2025 11:39 PM] azyms
Sorry I might not be much help


[11/14/2025 11:41 PM] azyms
Just move the file you just downloaded into the fallout 4 game folder then try to install anomaly and see if it works


[11/14/2025 11:42 PM] azyms
Actually I can send you the all the depot files in DMS as well if you upgrade to anniversary to downgrade but for now I will just send you the DLC workshop file


[11/14/2025 11:42 PM] azyms

A sniper rifle helps. I waited for the Deathclaw to come out. He kills some of the Raiders, then they kill him. Then I just picked off the rest of the Raiders. I picked the Hunter background.

Hey wastelanders, this modlist looks awesome. Does this modlist still work with the new anniversary update, or would I have to downgrade the game version to use this modlist?

no you have to be on next gen until a downgrader comes out that works with the anniversary update. go to #🆘𝑺𝒖𝒑𝒑𝒐𝒓𝒕-𝑭𝒐𝒓𝒖𝒎  and open the game file source missing files post for instructions on how to downgrade

Yo, I’ve been playing through so far and it’s been pretty fun, I’ve run into an issue of getting purified water. There’s not many guides or explanations, I’ve got three industrial purifiers, but I’ve got no clue how to get them to produce anything but dirty water. 
I searched through the chat to find solutions first but nothing really came up. I’m not sure if it’s Damn Apocalypse or if immersive water purification is still in but I don’t think I have access to either means of purified water lol. 
Chem100 & Sci100.

First time playing modded fallout has been fun!


[11/15/2025 10:47 PM] kazifca
I also took a look through MO2, in and out of the game to see if I can find a setting or control, but I couldn’t locate anything that pinged to my eyes.


[11/15/2025 10:48 PM] xtinytien
totally random question how do i lean


[11/16/2025 12:05 AM] yotsuhirasaka
There's a *Watercrafting Bench*


[11/16/2025 12:06 AM] yotsuhirasaka
I recommend using the Lone Wanderer Hideout in Concord though, uses Fusion Cells to fabricate Purified Water


[11/16/2025 12:06 AM] yotsuhirasaka
Alternatively if you go through the Survival Perks, Boiling Water is a pretty cheap recipe


[11/16/2025 12:07 AM] yotsuhirasaka
This has a multitude of steps but you get the schematics at the Engineering Bench using a Crafting Journal which is made at a Utility Bench using Overdue Books. 
May have a skill requirement, can't remember off the top of my head.


[11/16/2025 12:09 AM] kazifca
Man that’s a whole crafting tree lmao reminds me of the overcomplicated craft, thank ya I appreciate it I will in fact go do that!


[11/16/2025 12:10 AM] kazifca
I’m new to fallout modding and did no prior research before starting this play through, is this the vault tec offices? Elevator that goes down into a whole warehouse that you can build in?


[11/16/2025 12:12 AM] yotsuhirasaka
THERE'S A SETTLEMENT DOWN THERE?


[11/16/2025 12:13 AM] yotsuhirasaka
But no it's literally the opposite compass direction (South instead of North).
IIrc to unlock the hideout you have to get an item from the museum for the robot outside.


[11/16/2025 12:14 AM] kazifca
Yes, it also has a purified water thingy! Though it’s damn expensive lmao. Fusion cores for water is rough.


[11/16/2025 12:15 AM] kazifca
Ahhh that place, yes, I find it lags the ever living shi out of my game, I use the abandoned tunnels

Hello


[11/16/2025 11:55 AM] kazifca
I looked farther back and found my answer for water. 
This may be due to my red/green color blindness, but anything but pitch black & broad daylight has so much red/orange/black contrast it kinda makes it like, impossible to see anything at all. The flashlight is also basically useless, forest's under the daylight & pitch black conditions are fine but like 5-8am, and 5:30-9pm is downright brutal. 
I quite like the darkness, but is there a way to specifically tune that red/black contrast down in MO2? Hard to see is cool, impossible to see is a lil diff.


[11/16/2025 1:16 PM] ph4nt0mbr
Use Heather as a companion until she opens her bunker for you. Inside, every water you gather is purified water. She's also the funniest companion I ever had. She also sings with dogmeat


[11/16/2025 1:16 PM] kazifca
This would effect lone wanderer though no?


[11/16/2025 1:17 PM] ph4nt0mbr
Yes, it would, but you only need to travel around with her. she has a personal "quest line" to go to specific places and gain affinity with her.


[11/16/2025 1:18 PM] ph4nt0mbr
Is kinda easy to do her progression, and the bunker don't require her permanently as a companion


[11/16/2025 1:19 PM] kazifca
I see I see, thank you


[11/16/2025 1:20 PM] ph4nt0mbr
If you're using a mask modded by Gas Masks of the Wasteland, turn off the visuals overlay in game. Open the MCM Config and go Survival/Damn Apocalipse/Radiation Module. Is the last option


[11/16/2025 1:20 PM] ph4nt0mbr
Maybe helps, maybe not. Trying is worth


[11/16/2025 1:21 PM] kazifca
Yeah, I added the stalker mask to the database as I was fw the fit.
Gimmie a sec lemme try that


[11/16/2025 1:32 PM] kazifca
Yes that worked! and I will just do this but I think what I’m looking for is not available without me doing coding 😭 thank you very much though that solved my biggest issue so far lmao


[11/16/2025 1:34 PM] ph4nt0mbr
You're welcome. I've been literally keeping the Gas Masks turned off so I didnt have to walk around with gas masks. I'm happy it help, even a little


[11/16/2025 1:38 PM] yotsuhirasaka
-# If it still works the way it used to, Dogmeat and Heather don't disable Lone Wanderer. Dogmeat is treated as an Animal Companion, and Heather runs on her own Follower Framework. (Not sure if the same applies to **Robots**, but it might.)

Love the filter mechanic & gas masks tbh, it’s just the saturation during a few hours that are just too much on the eyes, I also explore for like multiple days at a time in game so I run through consistent periods where I just have not an idea of what I am aiming at

[11/16/2025 1:47 PM] kazifca
Sorry, if this was Minecraft I could talk about mods as if I know them, I haven’t gotten to a night yet but the morning and midday are good. 
There was just too much wee hours & evening contrast with the overlay on


[11/16/2025 1:47 PM] kazifca
Whenever red/orange began to shine through it just literally wasn’t visable


[11/16/2025 1:48 PM] kazifca
Like nothing, at all


[11/16/2025 1:48 PM] kazifca
I was relying on a concrete reflection to get into the tunnels 😭


[11/16/2025 1:49 PM] kazifca
Actual darkness was fine, but I’m pretty sure the mask overlay changes the actual light physics or something like that. They definitely produce less ambient light with a mask on


[11/16/2025 3:54 PM] kregond
She's already powerful enough (her PA has infinite endurance by default, she also has infinite ammo by default iirc), but you gotta test to see if influence perks work, vanilla perks like inspiration would work, if YAE perk has the same tag then probably yes, otherwise probably no. Also Lonewandere works on her, you could easily check your carryweight to be sure, or make a save before taking that perk.


[11/16/2025 4:06 PM] kazifca
Ah, infinite endurance definitely is something of note. Ok cool, I’ll go snag that, all that’s been holding me back is purified water for better foods & medicine lmao

[11/17/2025 8:01 AM] kregond
Yes, and couple other people has this issue as well, I have to navigate pipboy and lot of ui using keyboards, and some of them don't work as well. Only known way to "solve" is to exit and relaunch the game, depend on how this ofthen is this on your system, it might be very annoying, luckily for me, it is not that ofthen


[11/17/2025 8:06 AM] kregond
afaik, enemies either have set levels or have same levels as you. so you avoid going to the high level areas until you are ready. Aim for their head with most non-auto weapons would result in a instant kill, however they do that similarly to you too (so remember wear a helmet and mod it to have MAIM helmet), so you have to think before you fight, that's part of the fun of this modlist.
MCM might have some mods configuration that somehow reduce difficulty indirectly, like YAE you could change that to get more skill points per level, so you become better very fast, and when you are confident enough you tune that back down.


[11/17/2025 10:26 AM] yotsuhirasaka
I dont know that enemies even are leveled in this, since Scourge is present

I was so looking forward to playing this, it was so slick and polished. I can’t believe it ended like this. It’s just like what happened with Lost World and related packs. Fuck. Why couldn’t development have continued with a reversion script or something, to keep it on the same FO version.

On another note, I see the NV 12.7mm is in there, so is a riot shotgun which isn’t the NV specific one I don’t think. 
Totally looking to do a drunken gambling ranger play through, is there any other items of note returning?


[11/17/2025 4:26 PM] dagfinn_01993
is it possible to create 556 ammo on the ammo work bench? only seem to have basic types avaliable despite being 100 gunsmith


[11/17/2025 4:57 PM] cbsgaming
Anyone know if certain guns are better against certain foes


[11/17/2025 9:57 PM] kordigoth
what are some settlment suggestions for a base? besides the abondoned tunnels


[11/17/2025 10:08 PM] hellishjaxx
does anyone know how to disable or raise the fps cap? its 120 in game and 60 in the pipboy and menus i saw in the nvidia reflex support mod there was an fps limit enabled for 120 and i set it to false but its still capped


[11/17/2025 10:29 PM] badkwama
Hey quick question if i downloaded Life in the ruins then decided to change to anomaly can ii use the same DL folder because i presume they share alot mods in common without it screwing up the installation by installing every mod there ?


[11/17/2025 10:31 PM] zzzaacchh
Quick question - does Anomally still work with the new update? And if not, how would I be able to continue to play? (I haven't updated my game yet, and haven't read anything in here yet, so sorry if this question has already been answered multiple times).


[11/18/2025 3:47 AM] seregonofcatarina
I made the red rocket my base just for the workbenches and stuff


[11/18/2025 3:47 AM] seregonofcatarina
also it's close the abandoned tunnels for fast travel reasons


[11/18/2025 5:37 AM] kregond
some settelements close to tunnels or have APC or Boat fast travel points, like Red Rocket mentioned, or the Castle. The list also added a couple fully functioned player house as well, like concord hideout, pump house, top loft (this one points to a random encounter at its door, so each exit from it would likely cause a random encounter and reset of a box nearby), if you are not going to do supplylines or use fast travels.


[11/18/2025 5:39 AM] kregond
I think u have to reverse engineer most ammo from the engineer bench, and some weird ones need perks to unlock


[11/18/2025 5:39 AM] yotsuhirasaka
Its a bit complicated


[11/18/2025 5:40 AM] yotsuhirasaka
You have to edit one of the three HighFPSPhysicsFix.ini


[11/18/2025 5:40 AM] yotsuhirasaka
I *think* its the one thats packaged under Anomaly's stuff


[11/18/2025 5:41 AM] yotsuhirasaka
You can find it through the MO2 Right Pane's Data section,
Fallout4/Data/F4SE/Plugins I believe. 

Again, this is a bit more complicated than basic end user I'd recommend not touching if you dont understand


[11/18/2025 6:43 AM] frosty0898
Found a Saw and found the Lynx power armor. Time to run around like part of the wolf brigade


[11/18/2025 8:18 AM] rottenworm.
Hi, saw a video at youtube and trying to install the mod.


[11/18/2025 9:12 AM] terroristpotato
Does the death claw spawn at concord still?


[11/18/2025 9:12 AM] terroristpotato
If you cant use the power armour, do you just gotta skip it? Only level 4


[11/18/2025 9:16 AM] cbsgaming
the second round of Raiders and Deathclaw spawn after you speak to Preston not based on the Power Armour


[11/18/2025 9:17 AM] cbsgaming
just leave the power armour


[11/18/2025 9:18 AM] seregonofcatarina
if you have shotguns or 308 round weapons (hunting rifle, bolt action pipe rifle etc.) you can 2 or 3 shot the deathclaw on the head


[11/18/2025 9:18 AM] seregonofcatarina
you can cheese him from the building just across the museum


[11/18/2025 9:19 AM] cbsgaming
yeah why is it so weak


[11/18/2025 9:20 AM] seregonofcatarina
it's called rabid or weak if I'm not mistaken


[11/18/2025 9:20 AM] seregonofcatarina
that's why it dies so quickly


[11/18/2025 9:20 AM] cbsgaming
oh so its a unique version now


[11/18/2025 9:20 AM] seregonofcatarina
normal deathclaws take 5 shot from my explosive revolver


[11/18/2025 9:21 AM] seregonofcatarina
there's 5 or 6 versions of deathclaws I guess


[11/18/2025 9:21 AM] seregonofcatarina
there's a chameleon one


[11/18/2025 9:22 AM] cbsgaming
is that 5 or 6 extra ones on top of the base game ones


[11/18/2025 9:22 AM] seregonofcatarina
idk


[11/18/2025 9:22 AM] seregonofcatarina
I did not play the base game that much


[11/18/2025 9:22 AM] seregonofcatarina
so I'm not sure


[11/18/2025 9:22 AM] cbsgaming
i think there is about 4 or 5 in base game


[11/18/2025 9:23 AM] seregonofcatarina
I guess i finished the story on level 35 on base game so no info about high level deathclaw types on my side


[11/18/2025 9:24 AM] cbsgaming
you got nuka world one and a mythic one (high level version)


[11/18/2025 9:25 AM] seregonofcatarina
definetly more than them


[11/18/2025 9:26 AM] seregonofcatarina
I killed a legendary chamaleon deathclaw like a day or two ago


[11/18/2025 9:26 AM] seregonofcatarina
so definetly more than the base game


[11/18/2025 9:26 AM] cbsgaming
yeah i have seen an Alpha one and Glowing one then maybe more in just base game


[11/18/2025 9:27 AM] cbsgaming
but yeah def way more now


[11/18/2025 9:27 AM] seregonofcatarina
but still they hit like a truck


[11/18/2025 9:28 AM] cbsgaming
yeah which i like


[11/18/2025 9:41 AM] hellishjaxx
Awesome thank you I’ll look for it next time I’m on and make backups just in case I figured it was in an ini somewhere I just wasn’t sure which one thanks!


[11/18/2025 10:38 AM] dagfinn_01993
Hey guys i have a question. Im running Anomaly but my wife has said she would like to try fallout 4 so if I downloaded fallout via pc gamepass would it act as a standalone that has no connection to my steam/modlist fallout 4? I wouldn't put her through Anomaly on her first try


[11/18/2025 11:53 AM] cbsgaming
yes its a differant copy if your main one is on steam

quick question about the pagefile set up (it's a yes/no question so I don't wanna clog support with another thread). i have 64 (or rather 63.9( GB of ram, should I still do the 1.5 x RAM as page file, or just set is for the amount listed for 32gb?

A lot of recipe stuff is kinda messy


[11/18/2025 9:08 PM] yotsuhirasaka
You use the Engineering Workbench to create the Ammo Workbench Schematic which uses a Crafting Journal (made at the Utility Workbench using an Overdue Book and components) then you deconstruct multiples (10-100) of a specific ammo at that Engineering Workbench to gain a schematic for crafting it at the Ammo Workbench.


[11/18/2025 9:09 PM] yotsuhirasaka
There's also perks that add different crafting as well


[11/18/2025 9:09 PM] yotsuhirasaka
Like the Pipe Guns, Harpoons, yadah yadah


[11/18/2025 9:09 PM] yotsuhirasaka
You can make almost anything in the game it's just a matter of when and how are you gonna get a schematic for it

Yes


[11/18/2025 10:10 PM] renegadepride
thanks


[11/18/2025 10:46 PM] tiburse
For now you'll have to downgrade using the steam depot method


[11/18/2025 10:47 PM] tiburse
The hot fix Bethesda deployed broke most of if not all downgrade methods again.


[11/18/2025 10:47 PM] renegadepride
yeah just found that out

Will adding points to Demolition help with the insane blast radius of explosives like frag grenades?


[11/18/2025 11:14 PM] pinkpokemonstreaming
So is the official readme wrong (it says to update to latest so that Wabbajack can downgrade), and you need to downgrade (via the steam depository what not) before running the Wabbajack installer?


[11/18/2025 11:22 PM] tiburse
Here's the thing, Bethesda is updating faster than the mod/pack developers can keep up. Keep in mind Bethesda gets paid to do this where most mod devs and pack devs are all volunteers. We have lives, family, ECT. So the normal downgrade and root programs are not able to accommodate the now daily pushes from Bethesda. I would recommend doing the depot method once and hanging onto the files. That way when beth updates it's just a copy paste instead of the entire process.


[11/18/2025 11:24 PM] tiburse
This pack is also in a slight pause at the moment while we restructure dev roles and work in a new direction while keeping the same theme of survival alive. The current pack itself is considered a finished project. For more details check the announcement channel.


[11/18/2025 11:26 PM] pinkpokemonstreaming
My bad if it came off as being a complaint; I'm just looking for clarification if the html guide is or isn't accurate anymore.  Thank you for the info

So ENB continues to remove itself from the mod folder is anyone else having issues with this and if you are how can I solve this?


[11/19/2025 1:09 AM] chainassassin
do you guys know how to make the uneducated shooter leaning mechanic work with controller?


[11/19/2025 1:46 AM] walkmahone
Yes, I would like to know as well.


[11/19/2025 3:51 AM] tiburse
You would need to check with the mod author / mod page for that one. I personally do not know as I can not play a shooter without kb/m.


[11/19/2025 3:52 AM] tiburse
ENB's do not go in the mod folder is why haha. When you snag one you have to manually download it and put it in the root folder for the pack. (ours would be the stock folder, other modpacks may vary, just look at the start in line for F4SE on mo2 to find out where it goes)


[11/19/2025 4:31 AM] cbsgaming
To be fair i put the ZIP file in the wabbajack downloads then ran the modpack installation and it sorted it all out for me


[11/19/2025 4:36 AM] tiburse
Oh, you ment the ENB master file. I am sorry, I thought you were talking about adding your favorite ENB. My bad.


[11/19/2025 4:41 AM] cbsgaming
Oh yeah i quite like the current ENB that comes with the modpack as it fits the theme nicely


[11/19/2025 4:43 AM] tiburse
It do! However, I prefer a more subtle ENB myself.


[11/19/2025 5:27 AM] ph4nt0mbr
My dudes, quick question the .44 revolver still in the game, or it has a skin change to the desert eagle? And if has the skin change, the perk gunslinger work with it?


[11/19/2025 6:14 AM] ph4nt0mbr
Not gunslinger, I mean the revolver proeficiency or it works with pistol proeficiency


[11/19/2025 6:34 AM] tiburse
Lord idk id have to look at the tags for it in xedit lol


[11/19/2025 6:38 AM] ddanderson
Hello everyone. Maybe someone can help me. I have tried several times to manually download the 501 ENB version and move it to the download directory. But Wabbajack keeps deleting it and the download fails. Any suggestions? xD

[11/19/2025 6:52 AM] seregonofcatarina
You can do a sniper build it's very powerful with the fatal headshot setting in the MAIM


[11/19/2025 7:07 AM] ddanderson
It just says that you have to download it manually. That's all I'm doing. But Wabbajack deletes it and tries to download it again. Oh well, too bad.


[11/19/2025 7:57 AM] divineofmadness
same thing happens with me


[11/19/2025 7:57 AM] divineofmadness
download enb place it in download folder run wabbajack, wabbjack errors out and deletes it


[11/19/2025 8:03 AM] divineofmadness
and cant open forum ticket cause it s a download issue


[11/19/2025 8:38 AM] kazifca
Western revolver is what you’re looking for, backstreet apparel has a standard unique one from regular old fallout 4


[11/19/2025 8:39 AM] kazifca
- also explosive


[11/19/2025 8:41 AM] kazifca
As for any other reg .44, I haven’t found a dang one


[11/19/2025 9:23 AM] robocoyote
what mod controls the loading screen? also are the stalker ui sounds somehow baked into the game somehow cause even replacing them with another still has certain sounds play even with it off in mo2


[11/19/2025 9:25 AM] robocoyote
actually wait nvm that might be a part of the tarkov thing lol

[11/19/2025 11:30 AM] kazifca
I think it has been replaced with the deagle, as you seem to find a pretty modded out one where you would find the .44 revolver in game, it also doesn’t spawn on any enemies but the deagle does


[11/19/2025 11:30 AM] yotsuhirasaka
I need an ENB with more Desaturation if you've any recommendations?


[11/19/2025 11:43 AM] cocobean876

[11/19/2025 2:30 PM] tiburse
Let me see if we are at a point to see if I can make any sort of announcemnt.


[11/19/2025 2:46 PM] tiburse
Okay, currently what I can say is we are on break until the Bethesda patching cycle is done. Given there are at least 2 more updates, not counting hotfixes, due by the end of the year. Each one of those will cause issues. Plus, you all know that the show will happen and we will get a ton of new mods created  Rather than us putting in the time and having to redo the same work every other week with the holidays on top of it; Subsequently getting burned out. We are just gonna do it all at once when they are done.


[11/19/2025 2:46 PM] tiburse
I may have a use for it once I start creating my own mod.


[11/19/2025 3:11 PM] pinkpokemonstreaming

🚙 🐎 :9136_Shaq_Hot_Ones:


[11/19/2025 3:13 PM] pinkpokemonstreaming
... Man, that'd be cool if there was a raider/tribe group that used mass produced stickers as a new form of heiroglyphics


[11/19/2025 3:13 PM] pinkpokemonstreaming
Or spray paint templates


[11/19/2025 3:15 PM] pinkpokemonstreaming
Maybe based from a prewar deliquent group, that used it to commuicate and stay safe from raiders and over time it became favored over writing.


[11/19/2025 3:16 PM] pinkpokemonstreaming
~~I never liked the ubiquitous 'raiders', makes sense for a ragtag group of a few, but for larger gangs its just so silly~~


[11/19/2025 3:19 PM] kazifca
Think of it more like a disenfranchised tag for an oppressor, that is how it’s used in a literature sense


[11/19/2025 3:20 PM] pinkpokemonstreaming
I get that, but I'd expect over time the most successful groups would form distinct cultures beyond 'destroy and pillage', and eventually pushed out the sort of generic raider culture we see, atleast from being the primary 'culture'


[11/19/2025 3:21 PM] pinkpokemonstreaming
I really liked that in New Vegas, there were only a handful of 'raiders', the rest were actual groups


[11/19/2025 3:21 PM] kazifca
Yeah, but if you’re the slave they’re all the same to you. Your perspective in game is that of no prior knowledge


[11/19/2025 3:22 PM] kazifca
In New Vegas for example, you had the Kahn’s but they actually did something in causing major problems for the NCR


[11/19/2025 3:22 PM] kazifca
The fallout 4 raiders are just kinda, feral people, like if the legion had no structure or hierarchy, it would essentially result in that


[11/19/2025 3:22 PM] kazifca
Nuka world was an attempt


[11/19/2025 3:23 PM] kazifca
Wasn’t like, fantastic


[11/19/2025 3:24 PM] pinkpokemonstreaming
The thing is over 200+ years, why would they persist? Eventually groups with more stable structures would emerge, destroy or subsume less succesful raider gangs, until 'raider' would be what they were but not 'who' they were. Like the gunners are 'raiders', but they are distinct atleast (also wish they had more thought put into them).


[11/19/2025 3:24 PM] kazifca
Well they do, but they use a feudal system realistically, so it can’t be stable


[11/19/2025 3:25 PM] pinkpokemonstreaming
Although it could be interesting as an angle of a conspiracy to keep the commonwealth from uniting could be destroying groups before they got organized


[11/19/2025 3:25 PM] kazifca
If not, even earlier, tribal


[11/19/2025 3:25 PM] kazifca
Tribal could be stable if it was self sustaining, but raiders aren’t canonically


[11/19/2025 3:26 PM] pinkpokemonstreaming
Tribal organizations still typically have structure, just not centralized in the western sense and built out of familial and clan relationships.


[11/19/2025 3:26 PM] kazifca
Feudalism has structure, the difference is in stability is if you can produce enough for yourself and the people around you


[11/19/2025 3:27 PM] kazifca
And like, they just wouldn’t, and I can only imagine the average life span of a person in fallout


[11/19/2025 3:29 PM] pinkpokemonstreaming
It's just not very believable I guess, that radiers would persist, have essentially a unified aesthetic and culture of chems and blood, be too unstable to form any sort of distinction from one another, have an over arching confederation, and not get pushed back by settlers with more stable systems and preservation/passing of generational knowledge.


[11/19/2025 3:31 PM] pinkpokemonstreaming
That's why I like Nukaworld (in theory atleast, it was kinda lame in execution), it was a stable society based around three clans essentially that a permanent capitol but were otherwise migratory for slaves and tribute


[11/19/2025 3:36 PM] kazifca
I think what you’d prefer is the pit as a basis of raider ‘identity’. However, nuka world was not a stable society, it was poorly written. You have all these assassins and murderers who could’ve revolted against the guy outside of the car arena, or just lock him in there and let him starve, and they wait for you


[11/19/2025 3:38 PM] kazifca
It just doesn’t make sense realistically, and kinda throws the whole raiders having mad balls concept out the window. 
Nuka world is also an example of nationalism on a tribal scale, none of these ‘tribes’ actually work together, they stay out of one another’s way


[11/19/2025 3:39 PM] kazifca
It’s more like an agreement to not shoot each other and shoot others as opposed to ‘society’


[11/19/2025 3:40 PM] kazifca
There’s internal, nationalistic senses of interaction & you can see the various groups talk, but they clearly don’t like each other and view them as sub-themselves


[11/19/2025 3:41 PM] kazifca
Nuka world presents more so a commentary on the issue of ‘I’m better than you’ but everyone they’re saying it to has the same enemy, may not have been intentional on Bethesda’s part tho


[11/19/2025 3:43 PM] kazifca
Without some form of management they completely breakdown into hating on one another, which is the whole point of Nuka world, you’re supposed to be ‘whipping the place into shape’. 
I wouldn’t call that stable, I’d say that’s a conditional market


[11/19/2025 3:50 PM] kazifca
Also, as long as there is beer to be drank, drugs to be done, and highs to find, someone out there will be doing it


[11/19/2025 3:50 PM] kazifca
Humans have been gettin messed up since we were cavemen lmao


[11/19/2025 5:54 PM] pinkpokemonstreaming
Definitely poorly written. I liked the theory though of a confederation of three raider tribes who squabled for leadership but had created a functional foundation that could withstand said squabbling (such as through succession laws, rituals, and decorum).


[11/19/2025 6:13 PM] kazifca
That’s not a functional foundation though, that’s hierarchy for control. The functional foundation is your things like farmers, Nomads, travelling merchants, carpenters, etc. 
the raiders don’t have a functional foundation to back their hierarchy so they’ll create small pseudo societies and eat themselves alive in pursuit of slaves & resources, they are modelled after humans. 
I agree, raiders should get more airtime but more so in the form of gage styled characters as opposed to Nuka World as a concept.


[11/19/2025 6:16 PM] pinkpokemonstreaming
A functional foundation can be like that if you have a tribute society. That's literally how the mongols worked.  You create a strong centralized military structure that collects tribute from smaller polities through brutal repression. It wasn't well written out, but Nukaworld could have been a wasteland version of Karakorum


[11/19/2025 6:17 PM] kazifca
That was the mongols means of control, thats not a foundation of society. Without the farmer, theres no need to threaten him


[11/19/2025 6:18 PM] pinkpokemonstreaming
I guess we have differing ideas on what a society is 🤔


[11/19/2025 6:18 PM] kazifca
No, you'd agree too if we had no farmers or food


[11/19/2025 6:19 PM] pinkpokemonstreaming
Food can be provided through tribute though, the society that controls and the society that produces don't have the be mutually inclusive.


[11/19/2025 6:20 PM] pinkpokemonstreaming
They can be paralel


[11/19/2025 6:20 PM] pinkpokemonstreaming
The modern state idea of a society is... Well, modern. There are many other ways for societies to be organized


[11/19/2025 6:21 PM] kazifca
Two things co-existing doesn't imply they equate one another. Again, the foundation of society is your food & resources, not how you extract them out of your people


[11/19/2025 6:22 PM] pinkpokemonstreaming
I guess that's our disagreement, I don't think societies need to be conceptualized as a monolith.


[11/19/2025 6:23 PM] kazifca
Thats not a monolith, to have a society you require resources


[11/19/2025 6:23 PM] kazifca
There's no functional ideology, you starve otherwise


[11/19/2025 6:23 PM] pinkpokemonstreaming
If a desert society imports all it's food from other societies, is it not valid as  a society?


[11/19/2025 6:24 PM] kazifca
No, it means it’s foundation for the society is outside of the society


[11/19/2025 6:24 PM] kazifca
foundations rn


[11/19/2025 6:24 PM] pinkpokemonstreaming
lol, I'm not talking about foundations. But I think it's kinda run it's course as a discussion

Anyone having problems with ENB file not being recognized in the download folder by Wabbajack?


[11/19/2025 7:45 PM] jaro7785
yeah been stuck there for about 1 hour now >< tried everything 😛


[11/19/2025 7:45 PM] knowing_goyim
the enb makes the game unplayable anyway


[11/19/2025 7:45 PM] knowing_goyim
pitch black in gas masks


[11/19/2025 7:46 PM] knowing_goyim
i disable it


[11/19/2025 7:46 PM] takasuya8114
Would it just be enough to place the zip in the download file and start up Mod Organiser? Or is Wabbajack needed to install the mods as well, i'm not quite sure how the process still works


[11/19/2025 7:46 PM] jaro7785
no clue


[11/19/2025 7:47 PM] takasuya8114
I tried adding the zip file itself to the virus exclusion, that didn't work either


[11/19/2025 7:47 PM] takasuya8114
why does it keep dissapearing


[11/19/2025 7:47 PM] takasuya8114
-_-


[11/19/2025 7:51 PM] spli.t
its because the one you download from the enbseries website isnt the same as the one the modpack wants


[11/19/2025 7:51 PM] spli.t
the hash check fails and wabbajack deletes it


[11/19/2025 7:52 PM] takasuya8114
which one does the modpack wants? The anomaly website guide spefically links that one


[11/19/2025 7:52 PM] spli.t
i think its broken rn


[11/19/2025 7:52 PM] takasuya8114
Do you happen to know of any alternative links?


[11/19/2025 7:53 PM] spli.t
no i dont im stuck with the same problem too


[11/19/2025 7:53 PM] takasuya8114
of course this happens at exactly the moment when I just find the modpack


[11/19/2025 7:53 PM] takasuya8114
lol


[11/19/2025 7:53 PM] takasuya8114
why would it ever be easy


[11/19/2025 7:53 PM] spli.t
it never is


[11/19/2025 7:54 PM] spli.t
idk why they havnt fixed it


[11/19/2025 7:54 PM] takasuya8114
do you think the latest Fallout version is the issue? Should I downgrade to the previous version?


[11/19/2025 7:54 PM] spli.t
it seems like its been a problem for a few days now


[11/19/2025 7:54 PM] takasuya8114
i dont think its Fallout related, could be Wabbajack or that new enb update


[11/19/2025 7:55 PM] spli.t
well the update is part of it but they need to put in the right enb file for it to work anyway


[11/19/2025 7:55 PM] takasuya8114
I wonder if i try the previous enb version


[11/19/2025 7:55 PM] takasuya8114
would that work


[11/19/2025 7:55 PM] spli.t
i doubt it


[11/19/2025 7:56 PM] spli.t
wabbajack checks the file hash of every mod in the download folder and if it isnt the exact same as the one in the modpack it deletes it


[11/19/2025 7:58 PM] jaro7785
meh it sucks....was looking forward to try it out >< ahh well better wait and see if a fix is gonna show 😛


[11/19/2025 8:03 PM] takasuya8114
Yeah ,it's definitely a hash issue


[11/19/2025 8:03 PM] takasuya8114
when it downloads, it says it downloaded 5,6kb instead of 3,1mb


[11/19/2025 8:04 PM] takasuya8114
and the hash is just AAAAAAAAAAAA


[11/19/2025 8:04 PM] takasuya8114
when its supposed to be like qnmU31 etc etc


[11/19/2025 8:04 PM] spli.t
yeah and the one you download from the enb website isnt even 3.1mb its 3.5

[11/19/2025 8:06 PM] takasuya8114
looks like we'll need to wait for either Anomaly devs or ENB to fix it, probably on anomaly side


[11/19/2025 8:07 PM] takasuya8114
either way Fallout anniversary update is definitely at fault here


[11/19/2025 8:07 PM] takasuya8114
i will always chuckle at the comment i read the other day


[11/19/2025 8:07 PM] takasuya8114
"Breaking the game on its anniversary is peak Bethesda."


[11/19/2025 8:09 PM] jaro7785
yeah.....well it is Bethesda we talking about here


[11/19/2025 8:10 PM] takasuya8114

Anyone else having issues with Gasmasks 2287 ?


[11/20/2025 3:30 AM] monetaryfx
Defo bugging, the widget disappears, only recognizes certain gas mask that includes default ones and ones youve added. Switching the mod on and off in the mcm kinda fixed it but only the gas mask they give you from doing that seems to actually work which is odd. So if anyone else is having issues just do that lol. As for the widget i have no idea how to fix that and the animations stopped working ages ago for me when equipping and dequipping the masks, havent found a work around for that yet. But just to get through the weather i use the original mask they give you lol as none of the others seem to work at all.


[11/20/2025 5:17 AM] kazifca
I’ve had the widget disappear just today in the middle of combat, I just changed the filter and it reappeared. 
You can add something as a gas mask with the gas mask database manager, not sure if that’s what you’re looking for


[11/20/2025 5:18 AM] kazifca
I do it with the stalker mask

[11/20/2025 6:05 AM] monetaryfx
I ended doing a fresh re install and seem to have fixed it. I think whilst adding reactor and editing it for vivid weathers maybe borged some shizz up. But seems to running smoothly now. Saying that i do think the data base thing with the gasmasks mod bugs tf out at times. As the animations for equiping and removing the masks is a common bug on their mod page. I guess lesson learned is to not mess with to much with the list lol.

Surprisingly, I haven’t run into many bugs at all. I’m not sure if it’s the tried and tested hardware or I’m currently jinxing myself but shi been smooth as butter for me beyond a few crashes.
I changed the supply line Brahmin to eyebots so I don’t have to kill a Brahmin in the tunnels every 20 minutes, heavily debating trying to add ranger armour rn and that gun from NV.

🔥

[11/20/2025 7:31 AM] monetaryfx
Yeah its smooth. This latest build imo its decent. Ive added a few armors, few more things for the settlements to craft in like fences etc, and a companion. Getting reactor to work was probably the only real issue ive had. That an the gasmasks bugging but i think thats actually an issue with the mod itself not the list. I havent actually crashed yet myself too. But lets not jinx it 🤣

Hola buenas a todos


[11/20/2025 12:00 PM] yotsuhirasaka
-# :shrug: I'm not 100% if it works with the IRA system I'd mention, don't think they're considered "Gas Masks" by that system.


[11/20/2025 12:40 PM] kazifca
That one I can't answer beyond, I haven't gotten sick wearing the stalker mask since I added it.
I do take basically all survival & health oriented perks early so I might have a little bit of a better chance of not getting sick.


[11/20/2025 12:41 PM] yotsuhirasaka
Might also be affected by how much radiation resistance is on the item itself, or the player has, etc. I just don't know without looking into whichever plugin IRA comes from.


[11/20/2025 12:44 PM] kazifca
IRA is internal radiation sickness right? I think with led belly 2 you basically avoid most sickness, unless you've been breathing radiation. I've gotten lithium lung from running around with a broken mask on accident on a led belly 2 char


[11/20/2025 12:44 PM] kazifca
And as long as it functions as a gas mask actually within the database your rads won't go up so your IRA from that won't


[11/20/2025 12:46 PM] kazifca
I think its Damn Apocalypse that adds it

even stupider question: is harvesting meat from animals/bugs a Survival skill thing, a medical skill thing, or a perk thing?


[11/20/2025 1:17 PM] kazifca
Survival I’m pretty sure, there is some medical options for dismemberment tho

Closest to the entire left side of the map is Fort Hagen, Somerville, Vault 81, or Oberland.


[11/20/2025 1:52 PM] yotsuhirasaka

I do want to ask here rather than run another poll. What do you all think of the amount of scrap out in the world/difficulty.


[11/21/2025 1:10 AM] tiburse
downloads


[11/21/2025 1:11 AM] tiburse
Like inside the folder you told the pack to install to. Mine for example is "D:\Wabbajack\FOA Stable\downloads"


[11/21/2025 1:14 AM] crazykidonwheels
so it goes with the Wabbajack file or the Fallout 4 file

[11/21/2025 1:18 AM] tiburse
For example


[11/21/2025 1:18 AM] tiburse
If you are in the process of downloading you need to go to where you told wabbajack to install the modlist then inside that folder you will see a downloads folder.


[11/21/2025 1:18 AM] tiburse
It goes in there


[11/21/2025 1:28 AM] crazykidonwheels
i must of either did it wrong, somehow, or i dont see what your seeing in yours because in Wabbajack i have the install files set to the same drive and file location but i dont see that list


[11/21/2025 1:39 AM] tiburse
Thats just the name of the folder that I store all my modpacks, install tools, and dev tools in.


[11/21/2025 1:39 AM] tiburse

Are you able to use voice chat?

So how do I actually *use* Sanguine Surgeon? Do I need a special tool like I did for butchering?

(aka whats the perk do again)


[11/21/2025 2:09 AM] knifewizzerd
medicine perk that apparently lets you gather blood


[11/21/2025 2:09 AM] tiburse
OH


[11/21/2025 2:10 AM] tiburse
I think you need an empty blood pack


[11/21/2025 2:10 AM] tiburse
and be crouched at a human you should get an additional option other than take/inv


[11/21/2025 2:19 AM] knifewizzerd

Hello Guys, do any of you have the correct ENB File for installation ? The installer does not like the v0501 file that i got from the ENB Website :/


[11/21/2025 9:21 AM] cbsgaming
hey how you trying to install it


[11/21/2025 9:25 AM] robocoyote

[11/21/2025 9:28 AM] xblackmambarino
Hi, I am installing through Wabbajack. The problem is that after I downloaded all the mods, the installer said that it was unable to download ENB v0501.


[11/21/2025 9:29 AM] xblackmambarino
I tried to move the ENB file manually to the download folder but it keeps getting deleted at the installation


[11/21/2025 9:30 AM] xblackmambarino
It is almost as if i have the wrong File but its the only V0501 that is on the ENB Website ^^


[11/21/2025 9:33 AM] cbsgaming
Have you tried placing the ZIP file into the downloads folder and then running the installation thur wabbajack like normal


[11/21/2025 9:33 AM] cbsgaming
Thats what i had to do


[11/21/2025 9:33 AM] xblackmambarino
Yes but i keeps getting deleted after i retry the installation


[11/21/2025 9:40 AM] xblackmambarino
Does anyone still have their ENB that has worked and can upload it for me ? 😅


[11/21/2025 9:40 AM] cbsgaming
The whole thing as a Zip file not the seperate files


[11/21/2025 9:41 AM] xblackmambarino
Yes i dragged the ZIP file in the Download Folder where i puts all the other mods right ?


[11/21/2025 9:41 AM] xblackmambarino
And after that i click on retry on wabbajck


[11/21/2025 9:54 AM] cbsgaming
yes and it still didn't work? thats strange


[11/21/2025 10:02 AM] xblackmambarino
Alright. After looking at the logs i have found that the hash values are wrong. Wabbajack downloads the ENB with hash: AAAAAAAAAAA= but it needs: qnmU31ZwHIK=   At least thats what it needs in my case. The Problem is that Wabbajack just deletes the Files if they have the wrong hash values


[11/21/2025 10:05 AM] dagobertdogburglar
Could be reduced


[11/21/2025 10:05 AM] dagobertdogburglar
It’s on the generous side (not by fallout standards but like all survival games)


[11/21/2025 10:05 AM] dagobertdogburglar
FO4 is very prop and loot vomit and having less would be nice imo


[11/21/2025 10:06 AM] dagobertdogburglar
I’d always thought it was a tad silly how unlooted the world was after 200 years of post apocalyptic habitation


[11/21/2025 10:08 AM] kazifca
I think I agree with this man, but I'm more so of the idea that it should be harder to get scrap & resources from encounters. 
I'm not sure if reducing would still equate to fun further though as you're basically always looking for adhesive, or oil until you get compost crofter.
Better enemy AI, make death claws move like bloat flies imo


[11/21/2025 10:18 AM] mr.hex6251
Hi everyone, I'm new and I need the fallout version 1.10.984.0. I would be very grateful to anyone who could send me the files.

[11/21/2025 1:35 PM] crazykidonwheels
the enbseries zip file is still not working


[11/21/2025 2:18 PM] jaro7785
I have pm you one that works


[11/21/2025 2:31 PM] tiburse
I was gonna say, Looted world removes about 65% of it: https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/62110

I think part of the problem is there is no real loot sink in the current version.


[11/21/2025 2:31 PM] tiburse
How do you all feel about SS2?


[11/21/2025 2:32 PM] robocoyote
It’s a fun mod but I can see the problem coming with how much scripting there is


[11/21/2025 2:33 PM] tiburse
I mean nothing we have really uses a ton of scripting


[11/21/2025 2:33 PM] 74thammeck
I got questions does anomaly have leaning in game ?


[11/21/2025 2:33 PM] robocoyote
I’ve never actually completed the full quest line before, just the chapter 1 back when it first came out and then part of chapter 2


[11/21/2025 2:34 PM] tiburse
plus with baka scrap heap, xcell, and the new frame gen mods, along with some of my own edits it will open it up quite a bit with the edits.


[11/21/2025 2:34 PM] tiburse
I am mostly thinking about using it for the long games.


[11/21/2025 2:36 PM] tiburse
Like in terms of assaults, defense, and what-nots


[11/21/2025 2:36 PM] tiburse
Kinggath cleaned up the scripting a TON


[11/21/2025 2:44 PM] yotsuhirasaka
:shrug: I do plenty of modifying stuff which keeps me cycling, though I've just achieved post-scarcity with hundreds of points spread around- 

I don't particularly think it needs tweaking, SS2 would be awesome though (would appreciate America Rising 2 integration)

[11/21/2025 2:48 PM] tiburse
AR2 Is gonna be the hard part, as you would have to make a scripting mod to add them into SS2s ending(ss2 spoilers ahead) ||ch3 ending has all the factions coming together against the gunner threat. With the gear overhauls we are already working on for them its gonna make them a real pita. || As, if you finish the AR2 line of quests it blacklists you from the other factions sadly.


[11/21/2025 2:48 PM] yotsuhirasaka
:cryIgnore:


[11/21/2025 2:49 PM] yotsuhirasaka
Ah fair, I'm still playing through AR2 for the first time really. Just finished where AR1 left off.


[11/21/2025 2:50 PM] knifewizzerd
is there ever a point where sneaking doesn't drain AP, or is that just a result of "Have you ever crouchwalked, it sucks!" ?

[11/21/2025 2:51 PM] yotsuhirasaka
Might be under Enhanced Movement? I'd have to check but I disabled it as well.


[11/21/2025 3:33 PM] robocoyote
Oh nice I was testing ss2 earlier just to see if it works with the concord overhauls but I haven’t really tested any big changes


[11/21/2025 3:33 PM] robocoyote
Uh oh


[11/21/2025 3:34 PM] tiburse
The big problem is Concord personafied (and any other mod that adds a door to a building that SS2 adds a door to)


[11/21/2025 3:34 PM] tiburse
Im gonna be honest, Im tempted to just drop that mod...


[11/21/2025 3:34 PM] robocoyote
Yeah I was thinking that probably would be a probably


[11/21/2025 3:34 PM] robocoyote
Problem

huge fun but rarely compatible + lot of script bloat


[11/21/2025 3:45 PM] dagobertdogburglar
in my saves i actually use SS1 bc it’s comparatively lightweight


[11/21/2025 3:45 PM] tiburse
I mean SS2 isnt that bad considering its pretty much a full game in a game.


[11/21/2025 3:46 PM] tiburse
Thats part of why we are going with a spiritual successor. To much to patch to get it working in the current version. Along with other mods.


[11/21/2025 3:47 PM] dagobertdogburglar
i may be a minority here but really the core thing about it i enjoy is self-building settlements. to me the rest of it - while cool - is essentially a fancy package for that functionality.


[11/21/2025 3:49 PM] robocoyote
Oh no 😭


[11/21/2025 3:49 PM] robocoyote
Good luck


[11/21/2025 3:50 PM] tiburse
I mean thats true. I enjoy self building as well. I am making sure to include the manual plots that you can build your own in game.


[11/21/2025 3:50 PM] tiburse
Thank


[11/21/2025 3:50 PM] tiburse
Its not that bad tbh. Most people end up taking anywhere from 12-16 hours.

Thankfully Im on 2022 hardware


[11/21/2025 3:57 PM] tiburse
I was able to get mutant menagerie working with it all at least. That was a big ask I noticed.


[11/21/2025 4:01 PM] robocoyote
Yeah was using that too, had grabbed the scourge and hotc patches for it


[11/21/2025 4:04 PM] tiburse
Its a In the ass to configure all of scourge for it.


[11/21/2025 4:04 PM] tiburse
at least with true damage


[11/21/2025 4:04 PM] tiburse
BLD works better in my opinion.

hey i hope this is the right channel--I've just started the game, and ive got a cesium cold, brittle bones and lithium lung... how do i cure them? im stuck at half health and half rads. none of the medicine in my inventory seems to do much, beer, potassium.. i assume i need a doctor?


[11/21/2025 8:24 PM] suplex_
Does anyone have the enb file that actually works


[11/21/2025 8:27 PM] theeverprophet
im guessing i need cleansing tonic? if so does anyone know where to get that the fastest from santuary?


[11/21/2025 8:54 PM] kazifca
There’s a few options, but like you’re probably short on caps & resources to make said tonic early in the game. 
For your situation a doctor would actually be best just get it all gone in one go, I couldn’t find an actual cure to lithium lung beyond a doctor & I didn’t have the resources for tonics at the time. Luckily the medicine shop isn’t too expensive in contrast to the others , though it’s not a great solution early on


[11/21/2025 8:55 PM] kazifca
You might be able to make it to heather early on and she might be able to give you most of the resources for cheap, and getting into her bunker takes like 30 minutes of real life time


[11/21/2025 8:57 PM] kazifca
She also sells Detox tea, which might do what you’re looking for, and you can get it far cheaper than tonics

Hey guys, does anyone have a problem where Swan just decide hes tired of being in the pond and start to teleport to f*cking space??


[11/22/2025 8:28 AM] cbsgaming
did he clip into a building as that can cause a physics issue with bigger enemies where it just freaks out and sends fliying


[11/22/2025 8:30 AM] ph4nt0mbr
He's clipping on the water of the pond. I swear I have no idea how. I shoot him, he get out of the water and get abducted, then proceed to respawn like nothing happened


[11/22/2025 8:42 AM] cbsgaming
i would definitely say its a clipping physics issue but i don't know how you could fix it if possible


[11/22/2025 8:45 AM] ph4nt0mbr
Yeah, no. He's definitely clipping, but I have no idea where he's clipping and how

[11/22/2025 12:22 PM] dankkaneki
ill be honest, theres not much you can do for better performance. you can turn off the ENB for a performance boost, although i dont know if it will be much. at 600 mods, the game is kind of doomed to slug along unless you have a higher-end pc


[11/22/2025 12:24 PM] dankkaneki
i have a 3060 and an i7 12700f, i get like 45 fps average, 90-150 in interiors. i also recommend turning off shadow boost bc it caused enemies to pop in within like 10 meters of me and instakill me before i could react. it also boosts performance, so maybe its needed for you


[11/22/2025 12:25 PM] dankkaneki
as long as you keep the downloads folder, you should be able to mess with the mods pretty easily, and if anything gets broken beyond repair, just run the wabbajack install again and it will take a quarter of the time


[11/22/2025 1:08 PM] malignantbunny
Hello, which version of fallout do I have to own to run this mod?


[11/22/2025 2:36 PM] yotsuhirasaka
I think (keyword think) you can do something through the produce workbench actually but there's a lot of perks with food related stuff so I have no idea which (if any) I unlocked to do so


[11/22/2025 2:37 PM] yotsuhirasaka
What I know for certain is you can *make* the Wild versions there so I'd assume you can convert the other way


[11/22/2025 2:37 PM] yotsuhirasaka
:Shrugeg: But that's just a (Game) Theory


[11/22/2025 3:36 PM] knifewizzerd
alright, just got the pipe weapons build perk. How do I actually craft them, because it's clearly not at the weapons bench


[11/22/2025 3:38 PM] kazifca
Weaponsmith bench?


[11/22/2025 3:38 PM] kazifca
Or you need to make schematics


[11/22/2025 3:40 PM] knifewizzerd
Oh. Weapon*SMITH* bench. Got it. Damn, I'm gonna need a lotta benches if I MAKE shit at one and MODIFY it at another


[11/22/2025 3:45 PM] kazifca
Yes, you do end up needing quite a few


[11/22/2025 3:47 PM] knifewizzerd
ngl, KINDA feel like the armor smith/mod and weapon smith/mod should be unified into two benches


[11/22/2025 3:47 PM] knifewizzerd
but that's just me. Guess that's why you're given a batcave in the sewers

If I wanted to add commonwealth weaponry vendors that, I'm assuming would go in the economy section of the load order? Is there any issues with CWV and BCR in terms of compatibility in the pack?


[11/22/2025 5:11 PM] yotsuhirasaka
What's CWV


[11/22/2025 5:15 PM] kazifca
Commonwealth weaponry vendors


[11/22/2025 6:11 PM] knifewizzerd
So fun fact: When you spawn in power armor pieces for what should be the "A" variants, aka, the shitty rusty ones, it will randomize the armor piece.


[11/22/2025 6:12 PM] knifewizzerd
This is mildly frustrating, since I'm just trying to give the frame on top of the museum its missing parts, and I want them all rusty

[11/22/2025 10:27 PM] _niceguy
Basically autohotkey + auto clicker so I don't have to manually press download every time


[11/22/2025 10:59 PM] knifewizzerd
I'm definitely gonna have to mess with this HUD a bit. Everything's squished together and barely readable. Anyone have some good setups they wanna screenshot?


[11/22/2025 11:48 PM] knifewizzerd
Also, where is that little photorealistic army guy coming from? I can't seem to move him in particular


[11/22/2025 11:50 PM] knifewizzerd
the one that indicates limb damage


[11/23/2025 12:10 AM] _niceguy
Can you recruit npc in this mod?


[11/23/2025 12:42 AM] _niceguy
Bruh the more closer I'm into completing the mod pack the more slower it gets im at 950/976😭


[11/23/2025 1:02 AM] kazifca
That’s odd, are you doing anything else while downloading?


[11/23/2025 1:02 AM] kazifca
Ethernet or Wifi?


[11/23/2025 1:52 AM] _niceguy
X10 downloads at the same time is making it alow


[11/23/2025 2:04 AM] kazifca
Ah, yeah thats fair


[11/23/2025 2:13 AM] kazifca
How much VRAM & RAM does everyone's game use on average? I keep running into a driver crash, but it's odd because it happens at completely random times, one time while walking, another one while I was sniping a dude from 100 miles away, and just now scrapping a picket fence lmao. There isn't any clear indicators, though my memory usage slowly moves from 16-18gb on average to 22-24, VRAM ends up being similar, about 6 to 6.8gb then eventually continually topping out my GPU. Runs fine, temps are fine gpu runs at 80 degrees and the cpu runs at 70 tops lol, maybe a leak or something?


[11/23/2025 2:45 AM] kazifca
& whoever added the NIN radio, my god I was literally going to do that myself I love you, you are peak cinema


[11/23/2025 2:47 AM] walkmahone
Yeah, my RAM usage is around 22gb and VRAM around 6.5-7gb


[11/23/2025 2:47 AM] walkmahone
Just checked it


[11/23/2025 2:55 AM] kazifca

welp RIP to my 16gb and 6gb vram rig 😭


[11/23/2025 3:08 AM] _niceguy
im still 960/976 download


[11/23/2025 3:35 AM] kazifca
My CPU isn’t great so I use excess ram


[11/23/2025 3:36 AM] kazifca
Find your virtual memory settings, commit 24gb for your page file


[11/23/2025 3:37 AM] kazifca
Closest thing you can do to downloading more ram


[11/23/2025 3:41 AM] kazifca
If you’re running an AMD cpu & GPU find out if you can use smart access memory or SAM, there’s a way to do it with nividia but it’s not very accessible and takes a lot of jury rigging, it’s also not SAM. 
Essentially, SAM will allow your cpu & GPU to share memory when they feel they need it. 
Also note, my GPU VRAM is maxed out but its usage is like rarely above 85% which means I’m using excess and still have overhead.


[11/23/2025 3:43 AM] kazifca
If your rig is old, or has used parts, I’d take the time to check all your thermals, replace any dry paste, and throw thermal putty in places where thermal pads are, very thoroughly & gently clean the dust out of your GPU, isopropyl & ear swabs


[11/23/2025 3:44 AM] kazifca
It should actually run fine if your usages are higher than mine on average, you may not get 120fps fairly consistently outside of large ahh settlements tho


[11/23/2025 4:49 AM] _niceguy
961/976


[11/23/2025 4:49 AM] _niceguy

[11/23/2025 5:19 AM] _niceguy
hows your fps when playing with the mod?


[11/23/2025 5:21 AM] cbsgaming
Stable 60fps even in heavy combat


[11/23/2025 5:22 AM] _niceguy
this is nice


[11/23/2025 5:31 AM] cbsgaming
Just when its done make your pagefile at 40gb


[11/23/2025 5:35 AM] _niceguy
is that ok with pcie nvme?


[11/23/2025 5:38 AM] cbsgaming
Dont know as i dont own a NVME but should be fine as you will still have a pagefile that you can use


[11/23/2025 5:38 AM] cbsgaming
I am buying a NVME soon


[11/23/2025 5:38 AM] _niceguy
my ssd is broken


[11/23/2025 5:39 AM] _niceguy
it still has 300+ available storage, but the moment I add more files to it it lags even just 1gb


[11/23/2025 5:44 AM] cbsgaming
Yeah i do feel like you need to install it on a SSD or NVME as HDD is way to slow


[11/23/2025 7:22 AM] _niceguy

im stuck on a loop in downloading mods


[11/23/2025 10:47 AM] _niceguy

[11/23/2025 10:55 AM] kazifca
That shouldn’t be happening, do you know the read/writes on your SSD?

[11/23/2025 10:58 AM] kazifca
Can’t help ya with that one, don’t know much at all about modding. Your hardware though, always wanna make sure you’re not accidentally frying yourself, or something isn’t physically going wrong. Your SSD bottle bottlenecking like that stands out to me there


[11/23/2025 10:58 AM] _niceguy
thats the errors


[11/23/2025 10:59 AM] _niceguy
im installing it in my pcie nvme

My dudes, does anyone knows how in this forsaken land I can cook brahmin meat? Even mogrel meat. I just want to cook the 50 pieces of raw meat in my base


[11/23/2025 5:17 PM] knifewizzerd
I'm DECENTLY certain that Brahmin meat isn't in the naturally unlocked recipes leveling survival 1-50. I think it's in one of the feats


[11/23/2025 5:26 PM] kazifca
Tatos brother, tatos


[11/23/2025 5:40 PM] yotsuhirasaka
I *believe* a lot of meat recipes are under one of the Zoology perks. I'd have to double check.


[11/23/2025 5:42 PM] knifewizzerd
I *guess* that would make sense too


[11/23/2025 5:43 PM] yotsuhirasaka
-# :shrug: I know a lot of things but forget just as much, either run with the advice or don't- I'm not your dad.


[11/23/2025 5:46 PM] kazifca
So, you'll wanna look through survival. Master chef is the 'capstone' cooking perk so to say and breaks down into 2 categories majorly prior


[11/23/2025 5:46 PM] kazifca
Sorry I LOVE the cooking mod in this shi, you'll want gormad and au naturel?


[11/23/2025 5:46 PM] kazifca
I think is what they're called


[11/23/2025 5:50 PM] yotsuhirasaka
Just checked and yes


[11/23/2025 5:51 PM] yotsuhirasaka
Au naturel more specifically for most Roasts


[11/23/2025 5:51 PM] kazifca
Would very much so recommend taking master chef


[11/23/2025 5:51 PM] kazifca
Rocking 20+ charisma between alch and food is great for selling stuff


[11/23/2025 5:52 PM] kazifca
200+ extra carry weight


[11/23/2025 5:52 PM] yotsuhirasaka
Gourmand and Master Chef are the last big ones I've gotta do


[11/23/2025 5:52 PM] kazifca
Gourmand I got early, master chef I don’t pickup till around 30-35


[11/23/2025 6:16 PM] kazifca
With whiskey, and one of the master chef recipes for strength, you can give yourself like +13 str and an extra 300 or so carry weight.
Atomic cocktail gives 8 charisma, and the charisma master chef recipe gives you 8, before any gear bonuses or a stat higher than one you’re at 17 lmao


[11/23/2025 6:24 PM] knifewizzerd
hilariously, I don't actually think that lets you cook Brahmin meat


[11/23/2025 6:25 PM] knifewizzerd
I just took Al Naturel and Gourmand. Lots of cool stuff, cannot cook the radcow


[11/23/2025 6:32 PM] kazifca
Yeah I just stick with tatos, easy, can grab them and plant them within 10 minutes of exiting the vault. 
I just checked my recipes too, it seems like everything but Brahmin is there lol


[11/23/2025 6:33 PM] kazifca
Sorry didn’t have it open prior


[11/23/2025 6:37 PM] knifewizzerd
lol, you're good, but how hilarious of an oversight would that be if the one thing we cannot do with Brahmin is eat them? Hell, we can MILK them with the first perk in Lead Belly


[11/23/2025 7:21 PM] kazifca
I think they’re required for one of the master chef recipes


[11/23/2025 7:21 PM] kazifca
But I could be wrong tbh


[11/23/2025 7:22 PM] kazifca
I have never milked a Brahmin does Brahmin milk give solid buffs lmao

You can update to the latest version of FO4 but just make sure you download and replace the depots from that thread and you should be good


[11/23/2025 7:41 PM] _niceguy

You either need to make wabbajack redownload it by removing them or get it from someone and replace them in modlist download folder

I found this mod from some videos that popped up on YouTube so some of the beginning stuff got spoiled for me. My question is, is some of the stuff randomized? Like the starter pistol. I did a test run and it was missing for me, also the door to the room woth the cryolator was just not there on the test run.

[11/24/2025 5:14 AM] _niceguy

[11/24/2025 5:16 AM] cbsgaming
i think if you left click you can get a option to enable all mods


[11/24/2025 5:16 AM] cbsgaming
that should fix it


[11/24/2025 5:16 AM] _niceguy
enabling all the mods doesnt start fallout 4

SO are there additional bobbleheads for all the added skills in this game?


[11/24/2025 1:57 PM] knifewizzerd
so... is there something special I need to do to get power and water working in the Abandoned Tunnels? The Fusebox apparently makes 50 Power, and the redpipes next to it makes 30 Water. But I can't USE any of it for some reason. Any Advice?


[11/24/2025 3:11 PM] knifewizzerd
ok, figured it out. I think. Needed to wire the actual base. and I *THINK* in order to access the water, I needed to place a sink.

when looking at a settlement workshop theres an option (press space to manage) in this menu there is an option called layouts. what mod adds that?


[11/24/2025 4:04 PM] incredibleorphan

[11/24/2025 4:21 PM] zeldroth
You have to enable the "A - OPT -Uneducated Shooter - QE Leaning and Gun Inertia" mod in the Optional section in mod organizer.


[11/24/2025 5:07 PM] knifewizzerd

[11/25/2025 1:43 PM] knifewizzerd
Has anyone figured out Radstag and Brahmin meat recipes? Is there a skill magazine we need? Is it a feat? Is it just a higher Survival threshold?


[11/25/2025 1:45 PM] knifewizzerd
Because I have found grilled radstag and ribeye via console commands, but there's no way to actually make it, I don't think


[11/25/2025 2:39 PM] yotsuhirasaka
Theres definitely radstag

Cleansing tonic you can buy from Heather if I remember right. PB-jelly you can find in the world. But not sure if they only spawn after a certain lvl

I have the condition "internal bleeding" doing periodic damage and have no idea how to get rid of it. I've had the doc in Diamond city clean me of rads and patch me up but it wont get cured. help?


[11/25/2025 10:01 PM] pyromunky8347
Somewhere here in forum is the console command lines to use in steam to fix the game back to next gen update. You’ll want the game to be fresh with your anniversary and then do it. Best way to make it work.


[11/25/2025 11:48 PM] pearljamlover69
you have a working enb file for the modpack?


[11/26/2025 12:30 AM] pearljamlover69

Find an overdue book, craft a crafting journal(utility), you’ll need a certain amount of ammunition to make the schematic, it will appear at the engineering workbench once you have a journal in your inventory or have a journal in the settlement inventory


[11/26/2025 2:02 AM] kazifca
You are going to have to take the mod pack very slow unless you take scrounger as one of your first three perks


[11/26/2025 2:03 AM] kazifca
At bare minimum, invest one perk into scrounger, while I would recommend all three, you will need at least one to get anywhere in a comfortable amount of time


[11/26/2025 2:09 AM] malarkey94
Much appreciated.

I think the service rifle have a gl launcher. The "No Heroics" at least have. I didn't built to test, but in the weapons wrokshop there is


[11/26/2025 4:34 AM] kazifca
Ah, I’ll check that out then! I went ahead and added a rotary drum 25mm


[11/26/2025 4:35 AM] ph4nt0mbr
the no heroics have it at the barrel if I'm not mistaken, but I didn't mod that weapon because is just that good and cool to look


[11/26/2025 4:58 AM] spaceman2014
That's not a rad damage thing. You'll need perk that allow you to create medical items then craft item for it from chem station


[11/26/2025 5:21 AM] ph4nt0mbr
The white/yellow sirynge that says it removes radiation poisoning removes it


[11/26/2025 5:22 AM] ph4nt0mbr

What would that build consist of in terms of perks/outfit?
It sounds really interesting, might try that build out tonight:4299sabiondo:


[11/27/2025 10:58 AM] kazifca
All the ghoulish perks in medicine, nerd rage, basically every Chem and alch perk, you’ll want probably just two in lead belly, stealth because you’ll have like near no health all the time at, for equipment, all the really terrible radiation legendary effects become decent, and a ton of jet tbh. 
It could probably fully come together around level 21, survivability is the biggest thwarter of the game in this case. 
You’d probably still need to take scrounger at levels 1, 5 and 7 to comfortably acquire resources.
In standard fallout levelling you can get away with taking way more damage but I would probably throw this down as a very run and gun oriented build, complete stealth, or a heavy mixture of both. 
You’d be able to do a ton of melee damage, though even with full health & armour, melee builds in this mod pack are asking a lot.


[11/27/2025 11:41 AM] ph4nt0mbr

Most but not all; but off the top of my head the ones with zoom are the Remington 700 and AER-15. Not sure what others have zoom options.
They have craftable items (Utility or Chem workbench, can't remember which) to access zoom settings, or there's options in the Mod COnfiguration Menu.

Requires schematics and a bunch of other stuff, check out the Engineering Workbench. 
Once you've made the ammunition workbench you also have to make schematics to create each individual cartridge.

@Alda is a discord scammer guys she dm me with the "hey, do you play IK too?" scam for those who don't know i think IK refers to infinity kingdom and its a scam game that steals your card information just to let a mod know that there is a scammer in here messaging ppl

weirdness going on


[11/29/2025 8:26 AM] riflepoet
so I linked settlement to the underground hub thing


[11/29/2025 8:27 AM] riflepoet
I want that to be my main, but I cant place an ammo workbench there NOR do I see the items in the saznctuary workbench BUT when I go to build things the materials seem available


[11/29/2025 8:28 AM] riflepoet
OMG I JUST WANT ALL MY CRAP IN ONE PLACE ooooOOoooo


[11/29/2025 9:38 AM] _niceguy
I really hope wabbajack uses IDM/motrex for downloading :Cool_Finger_Guns_Crying:

Place a floor down


[11/29/2025 10:30 AM] kazifca
Ammo workbench can be placed on a floor or the bottom level of the tunnels


[11/29/2025 10:30 AM] kazifca
It’s funky yea but


[11/29/2025 10:32 AM] riflepoet
OK YES

sorry caps


[11/29/2025 10:33 AM] riflepoet
but wahts with the settlement connectioons?


[11/29/2025 10:33 AM] kazifca
Do you have enough influence to set up a supply line?


[11/29/2025 10:36 AM] kazifca
You also shouldn’t be able to see the items in the settlement inventories, they aren’t shared inventories unless something is being crafted or built


[11/29/2025 11:02 AM] riflepoet
baH


[11/29/2025 11:21 AM] riflepoet
ok... so are there any ways to fast travel from settlements?


[11/29/2025 11:21 AM] riflepoet
like build a caravan rig or soemthing?

[11/29/2025 12:11 PM] kazifca
APC just down the road from red rocket

Or go all the way to far harbour for a boat

[11/29/2025 2:18 PM] kazifca
To be fair


[11/29/2025 2:18 PM] kazifca
I have 10 deathclaw cages at finch farm


[11/29/2025 2:18 PM] kazifca
way faster to drive there than it is to tunnel


[11/29/2025 2:20 PM] yotsuhirasaka
Not really because there's the the Malden(?) Sewer which is literally like a hill over


[11/29/2025 2:22 PM] kazifca
Yeah, it's not the most massive of differences in time wise it's very minimal, but if you've also gotta hit 3-4 other settlements across the map the time begins to show.
APC also uses time & offers enemies at the end of a trip, I'd argue it becomes far most useful about half way through your time


[11/29/2025 2:23 PM] kazifca
The tunnels are also laggy asf, I will not lie, chunks like sanctuary


[11/29/2025 2:26 PM] kazifca
I have multiple full build meter settlements, tons of entities, moving objects and light sources, I'm using like 16-19gb max, the second I step in the tunnels/sanctuary it jumps towards 28gb, but I experienced the lag right from the start. 
There's definitely reasons you would want the APC for general travel over the tunnels, especially with a less powerful computer than my r5 5500 & 5700xt


[11/29/2025 2:37 PM] yotsuhirasaka
Oh 100% the APC makes a difference,
Just being able to get radiation poisoning cured is nice lmao

[11/30/2025 3:13 PM] diablomel
also, how can I re-enable manual saving? doesn't make any sense in a game that can crash at any moment


[11/30/2025 3:15 PM] moth_love
What I did was cheat in a bunch of cigarette packs. If you need to save, just smoke one


[11/30/2025 3:16 PM] diablomel
u have the console command in mind? that would save me from despair, I just crashed in concord, not 2hours in my first game and F4 crashes, fun


[11/30/2025 3:17 PM] moth_love
I dont know the exact code for it, but in console type in
help "cigarette" 4 alch


[11/30/2025 3:18 PM] moth_love
And yeah, I feel that. I dont typically have a lot of game time between work, school and having to turn in for the night, so as much as I love semi-realistic damage, dying to a lucky headshot from a bandit with an automatic .38 pistol and losing hours of gameplay isnt exactly something I enjoy


[11/30/2025 3:21 PM] diablomel
yeah but actually u could tweak this in MCM, my concern was really the crashes and game freeze to death, which I feel I will encounter fairly often


[11/30/2025 3:21 PM] diablomel
Disable player headshot and you're good with this I guess


[11/30/2025 3:25 PM] moth_love
Wasnt aware that was an option, i will check that out tomorrow

yep it's in MAIM I'm pretty sure, under combat


[11/30/2025 3:35 PM] diablomel
does one know why even tho' I reduced the disease chance to 0.10 I still get all of them back after 15minutes...? weak muscles, nuclear diarrhea, cesium cold etc?


[11/30/2025 3:36 PM] moth_love
How bads your radiation and ira? I did some digging around here for similar reasons and afaik, if your rads are high you get sick easier?


[11/30/2025 3:40 PM] moth_love
I think those diseases are a result of radiation poisoning tho


[11/30/2025 3:53 PM] diablomel
My rads I can see on the left, correct? what about Ira?


[11/30/2025 3:54 PM] moth_love
Your rad-boy, should be found in the aid tab, in devices


[11/30/2025 3:55 PM] moth_love
And yea, rads are the vertical green bar on the very left


[11/30/2025 3:56 PM] diablomel
and what's the difference between IRA and RAD actually? 😄


[11/30/2025 4:00 PM] moth_love
Take it with a grain of salt but I think IRA is your internal intake of rads. So food, dirty water, nuka cola, etc etc.
Your rads, the green bar, is external radiation from the environment


[11/30/2025 4:01 PM] diablomel
oh damn, alright good to know, but both values aren't the same, when u take radiations it's + and when u take Iradiations it's - I think


[11/30/2025 4:01 PM] moth_love
Yea, noticed that to lol

Unironically cigars. There is a cigar box with the text open in it, that goes to your aid tab on your pipboy. When you use it it gives you straight up cigars, who you can smoke to auto save the game

So I smoked a cigarette right outside of the South Boston area, found a couple Brotherhood guys in PA not too far in and I just followed them around for awhile in a long running gunfight with super mutants and raiders before being taken out by duo of suicide mutants.

there's a way to tune down skill points gained per level and per INT, in the MCM-YAE menu, as for xp itself, idk.


[12/2/2025 8:30 AM] ph4nt0mbr
Bro, I'll be honest, if you're playing on survival, you don't want to tune down the xp gain. This modpack is hard af


[12/2/2025 9:25 AM] therhythmz
ENB is found on their website. It wont allow automated download with wabbajack.


[12/2/2025 9:26 AM] therhythmz
Theres also other threads explaining similar stuff on the support channel


[12/2/2025 9:28 AM] therhythmz
I would also recommend that you don't touch YAE. its very finicky and a lot of other mods are resting on top of it and you may break your game.

Heres the working version: https://pastebin.com/0VMhCZUa (cant post link otherwise)
its from build.wabbajack.org/authored_files

do i need fallout to be updated to the current version of fallout cause i currently have it downgraded from when i played lost world


[12/2/2025 11:55 PM] moth_love
Pretty sure so long as the main files have been overwritten it should work?


[12/3/2025 12:03 AM] jamiejpack
needs to be downgraded, at least thats what I saw and it worked for me when I found the enb file


[12/3/2025 12:04 AM] moth_love
Im actually curious if my old vortex modlist works since I've overwritten the AE files with the previous version due to this pack.


[12/3/2025 12:15 AM] moth_love
unfortunately not


[12/3/2025 12:38 AM] tsukinocross
it didnt work downgraded, said i was missing game files so i updated it and still say im missing game files


[12/3/2025 12:38 AM] moth_love
neeevermind, it works, just had to double downgrade lmao


[12/3/2025 2:00 AM] tsukinocross
alright i redowngraded it after doing a fresh install, but it still didnt work but that was because i tried to do it without clossing wabbajack but after closing it and reopening it it worked


[12/3/2025 7:23 AM] turnip7870
im missing textures in concord, could anyone help me resolve this?


[12/3/2025 10:48 AM] diablomel
is this modpack even supported still? I feel like it is bugged and discord feels pretty empty, you even have to ask on the discord to finally get through the installation process. Kinda sad 'cause I'm playing since 15 hours and it had potential, but whenever I have a question mostly I get no help 🙁 Not blaming anyone just wondering

Hey, guys!
This modlist have Russian translate or it is English only?


[12/3/2025 8:30 PM] natekartier
i could find any troubleshooting info on whether we needed the season pass to play anomoly. I current just have fallout 4 no dlc


[12/3/2025 11:19 PM] tsukinocross
i believ you need them all except the hd textures one


[12/3/2025 11:20 PM] natekartier
thanks T cross, ya it looks that way


[12/3/2025 11:20 PM] natekartier
also it seams the whole anomoly mod is like 170gigs? or is that wrong


[12/3/2025 11:33 PM] tsukinocross
itll be double basically because it downloads it into the downloads folder then basically downloads them again into the actual mods folder, but then you can delete them in the downloads folder it just makes it way faster to update the modpack if you dont


[12/3/2025 11:34 PM] natekartier
holy shhtttt. hmm, i have been meaning to get another internal as i only have 1tb rn. im wondering if an external can assist the process but i doubt it


[12/3/2025 11:35 PM] tsukinocross
you can put the downloads folder in a seperate drive i believe, but i think it makes the download process a little slower i believe


[12/3/2025 11:36 PM] natekartier
ahh ok ya ill look into it


[12/3/2025 11:36 PM] natekartier
maybe wabbajack should be installed on external in my case. either way thnx for the help


[12/3/2025 11:48 PM] tsukinocross
i would just make sure wabbajack is on the same drive as where your installing the modpack


[12/3/2025 11:50 PM] tsukinocross
also if you use bitdefender i would suggest turning off advanced protection cause it can bypass exception like it did me and brick the whole install before you even get to play, currently in the process of trying to redownload it annd its been a pain

Is gas mask durability meant to go down all the time I spend outside? It says it’s at 100% but I’ve been moping around for an hour. Or am I just supposed to pull it out for like restrooms?


[12/4/2025 1:27 PM] mystalker
Radstorms, not restrooms lmao

Do you play without the sounds?

It's the player character dying :LMAO_Red:

[12/4/2025 5:20 PM] kazifca
The vault 111 government facility or military facility or whatever it is, is a great place to hit early on, you can land a rifle, shotgun, pistols, ammo, etc, and you get access to that vault which should have laser rifles, and a fair bit of ammo if you have scrounger


[12/4/2025 5:20 PM] kazifca
AR2 starting point


[12/4/2025 5:32 PM] kazifca
Also, if you want to mitigate the chances of that lethal headshot with the setting enabled, wear a helmet, go into the legendary slot at the armor bench and put on the MAIM armour type for it to register wayyy better than it usually does

sorry im late but its most likely you just have radiation poisoning, use the "Rad Boy" in your inventory and see if it tells you anything


[12/4/2025 8:57 PM] dankkaneki
if the rad boy says nothing, it's a bug(most likely), and if you get something about IRA it means you have rad poisoning. I had to cheat myself in a Cleansing Tonic through the console bc the doctor didnt properly cure my rad poisoning, instead just lowering my rad meter and leaving me to continually take rad damage

I went out of my way to collect helmets until I could find one to put a ballistic weave on. Noticed a pretty big change but the occasional headshot still happens, that or I'm getting hit with an M2. An Atom Overcoat and armor pieces should do pretty well for the rest of the body, the overcoat can have a weave too, which affects limb damage resist


[12/5/2025 7:02 AM] mr.shersh
I'm trying to figure it out.
Do I need the NG version or will AE do?
And does this modlist work with the OG? (just interested)
I see in the guide that I need make sure is my game updated to version 1.10.980.0. But anyway, do I need downgrade my game?
I have Fallout 4 GOTY 1.11.169.0 (exe version) from steam


[12/5/2025 8:26 AM] kregond
For the head, you want to mod the helmet with the MAIM helmet thing, to let it be recognized as a legit helmet to prevent you being headshotted with, say a 5mm (however that sacrifice one legendary slot). I remembered getting weaves on almost all body parts like scarf and even ring, to reach about 700 DR in the end. The hard part is the beginning, eventually you will become a semi-god, it's fallout 4 afterall.


[12/5/2025 8:28 AM] kregond
there's plenty chat and support in this chanel and support-forum. the dev team stopped (due to Beth being Beth) at the NG version of the game 1.10.980.0 iirc, so you need to do the work to downgrade to that version yourself.

[12/5/2025 8:35 AM] mr.shersh
Yes, I understand. At first, I thought the downgrade would happen automatically via Wabbajack (I didn't check the announcements and this is my first time using Wabbajack instead of building the game myself - it is new for me).
Yes, Bethesda is a masterclass in terms of falling into a puddle of crap.
I'm really glad they didn't introduce their own creative store or anniversary updates for New Vegas. Otherwise, I wouldn't have become a modder for this game lol

I have the same thing with other modpacks that dont feature hardcore damage mechanics like this pack does, I think its just a vanilla thing for explosive damage to go through walls

Combat leaning is installed but disabled by default, you have to get out of vault 111 before turning it on. It is in the Optionals list at the botton, called A- OPT -Uneducated Shooter - QE Leaning and Gun Inertia

The latest announcement says to use the  downgrader to downgrade FO4 to version 1.10.163.0, but the readme says version 1.10.980.0 . So I just want to be 100% sure which version is it so I dont f*ck this up?


[12/7/2025 4:52 PM] thisistotallysol
yep pretty much, put the zip in there. how about your depots install, so you just copied over the folder files per depot into the main steam install of fallout?


[12/7/2025 4:53 PM] nahraz
yes i downloaded each depot via the console, and copied the contents of the folder, in the order they are presented, into the fallout 4 directory


[12/7/2025 4:54 PM] nahraz
replacing everything each time


[12/7/2025 4:55 PM] mfreeze01
any of yall able to help me? Tried downloading the modlist via  wabbajack and it says there asre 18 missing game files


[12/7/2025 4:55 PM] nahraz
everytime i hit the "Retry" wabbajack deletes the enbseries_fallout4_v0501 zip from the modlist folder 😐


[12/7/2025 5:01 PM] thisistotallysol
i had this happen to me too, after a while of restarting wabbajack it eventually stuck. then that's when the voices.ba2 issues started


[12/7/2025 5:01 PM] thisistotallysol
exactly what we're trying to figure out right now. this should help, but seems like it doesnt work for all (me included)
https://discord.com/channels/1113971680419782666/1439282732860706816/1439318141552300102


[12/7/2025 5:03 PM] nahraz
depot_377164 is the depot with the voices


[12/7/2025 5:03 PM] nahraz
have you tried redownloading?


[12/7/2025 5:12 PM] thisistotallysol
yep, still nothing. it really is weird


[12/7/2025 5:13 PM] thisistotallysol
just redid the whole thing, and yep same issue same file


[12/7/2025 5:14 PM] nahraz
what does it say in blue on the right, in the log file you can create to see what is missing


[12/7/2025 5:16 PM] nahraz
the only other pointer i may have is that i did not start fallout 4 after my fresh download, i did the depot thing right after it finished


[12/7/2025 5:18 PM] thisistotallysol
when you show missing archives? Game file source


[12/7/2025 5:18 PM] nahraz
ok, just wanted to check if it is a mod or a original install file


[12/7/2025 6:23 PM] lexdrix
hey im trying to install now, says its missing game files? like Fallout4.ccc how do i get past this


[12/7/2025 6:44 PM] lexdrix
nvm i read, rip


[12/7/2025 7:59 PM] willyj_13784
hey everyone


[12/7/2025 8:12 PM] trevor6866
Has anyone installed the mod that removed character voice?


[12/7/2025 8:31 PM] thisistotallysol
Well i found a really werid but logical solution to that missing voices.ba2 issue. I had another FO4 modlist installed that uses the same version I think, copied that file from the stock game folder and put it in the steam data folder after doing the depots again. That worked, Anomaly is now currently extracting and installing. I hope it runs lol


[12/7/2025 8:46 PM] crimsoncoast
How do I enable manual saving in this game?


[12/7/2025 9:32 PM] moonslayer6695

[12/7/2025 10:38 PM] .chakas1068
is there a way to wear a hat and helmet? i wanna wear a boonie hat with combat armor helmet, anyone know a way? if this is the right place to ask


[12/8/2025 12:31 AM] dfeqz
is there a way by chance to be able to check the weather in game while ur indoors


[12/8/2025 12:35 AM] dfeqz
I guess I could just cheese it and reload+sleep longer until I find good weather lol..its kinda tough to step out just to check for half a second and my geiger counter fills up halfway.. First time playing :)


[12/8/2025 12:37 AM] admiralkobi
Howdy, pulling my hair out currently having the same 19 files saying they could not be found. Fresh install multiple times, followed literally everything to the letter. I've ran many mods from Wabbajack and unfortunately this is the first time I've had this issue. Lost and need help, lol.


[12/8/2025 12:37 AM] dfeqz
I had that earlier, the guide doesnt say you need to downgrade but you need to

[12/8/2025 12:42 AM] dfeqz
there was a couple things the guide didnt include that was needed iirc


[12/8/2025 12:42 AM] dfeqz
that was one of them..or maybe it was both..i cant remember already


[12/8/2025 12:44 AM] admiralkobi
Well I'm watching a streamer who also downloaded the mod from wabbajack and did not downgrade plus I believe it tells us that we need to ensure we have the up to date version of Fallout4 so not sure where these sources come from?


[12/8/2025 12:45 AM] dfeqz
Yeah it does say that, the guide just isnt updated


[12/8/2025 12:46 AM] dfeqz
thats kinda common for alot of modpacks actually lol


[12/8/2025 12:46 AM] admiralkobi
Ahhh interesting


[12/8/2025 12:46 AM] admiralkobi
I'm tryhing to look around to see and understand how to downgrade?


[12/8/2025 12:46 AM] dfeqz
the latest fallout 4 anniversary edition/update kinda ruined things..itd take months


[12/8/2025 12:46 AM] dfeqz
check the link I sent up there


[12/8/2025 12:46 AM] dfeqz
discord search is your pal


[12/8/2025 12:47 AM] dfeqz
everyones had the same problems already


[12/8/2025 12:47 AM] dfeqz
thats how I found out i needed to downgrade actually


[12/8/2025 12:47 AM] admiralkobi
let me check that link now. appreciate your help!


[12/8/2025 12:47 AM] dfeqz
if you read the whole thread I linked up there it should help you understand. I followed his instructions to a tee and it worked for me


[12/8/2025 12:48 AM] admiralkobi
gotcha yea I'll take some time to go over this, thank you again for your time


[12/8/2025 12:51 AM] admiralkobi
I think the other issue I'll end up having is that I also play Wasteland Reborn and Magnum Opus which did not need to downgrade. Not sure how that will play along once I start doing this downgrade business for this mod.


[12/8/2025 1:48 AM] zeallafattu
YO YALL


[12/8/2025 1:49 AM] zeallafattu
HI


[12/8/2025 1:49 AM] admiralkobi
At a new loss. Looks like the ENB is the only file I'm having issues with. I found a link to the 501 zip but even after installing it in my fallout 4 folder and then restarting Wabbajack, it continues to error out showing it's still missing the ENB. What am I doing wrong?


[12/8/2025 4:15 AM] gamedoggo
Thank you, this fixed all the missing files except enb, which I just downloaded manually. I wonder if this messed up because I down patched before install. :prayge:  The down patcher is working correctly.


[12/8/2025 4:21 AM] gamedoggo
I put the enb in the Wabbajack downloads folder, not the Fallout4 folder, and it worked. I am installing now :Pog:


[12/8/2025 5:44 AM] nahraz
nice, then have fun! the first molerats (doggy  event) put me in my place 👶


[12/8/2025 5:47 AM] nahraz
two other questions, 1st: when starting the game you are given the choise of difficulty (Survival, Anomaly Default, Easy and Immsersion Presets). Does anybody know where i can see what options are behind those difficulties? And 2nd: is there a kind of wiki where i can see what excactly one point in str, end etc. does. And if for example health (or points put in END) is given retroactively (like in FO4) or not (like in the other games)?


[12/8/2025 6:01 AM] thisistotallysol
for the first point, i think it's specifically for the gas mask stuff? i just picked anomaly default


[12/8/2025 6:05 AM] kazifca
As far as I know, the various settings effect gas masks mechanics & crafting mechanics, there could be others and surely there is, but those are what are most notable between my multiple play throughs


[12/8/2025 6:06 AM] kazifca
In the menu in game, you’re looking for the very first option to tweak everything MO2


[12/8/2025 6:07 AM] thisistotallysol
huh just noticed that the only ENB shows up without a checkmark by deafault, but there's an ENB already active in-game. any difference if i check it on vs off?


[12/8/2025 6:09 AM] kazifca
No clue tbh, only thing I did for the visuals was tone down the gas mask effect


[12/8/2025 6:09 AM] kazifca
For your second question lmao, no not really


[12/8/2025 6:28 AM] zems
how to heal radiation poisoning?


[12/8/2025 6:31 AM] kazifca
I’m gonna go 20 on cleansing tonic or visiting a doctor


[12/8/2025 7:15 AM] admiralkobi
I feel so noobish, where do I find all the keybinds for wiping mask and going into slow mode?


[12/8/2025 7:22 AM] thisistotallysol
In MCM, Interface, Hotkey Manager. should have everything, can rebind from there too


[12/8/2025 7:33 AM] thestarchgod
What is the key for enb


[12/8/2025 7:33 AM] thestarchgod

find radboy(in your invetnory) and add into favorites


[12/8/2025 9:02 AM] nahraz
ahhh, thanks!!


[12/8/2025 9:29 AM] moth_love
I'd recommend just making the habit of keeping your gas mask on whenever you go to sleep or step into an outside cell. Your filters wont get used up in "clean" air


[12/8/2025 9:34 AM] dfeqz
Thanks for the info I was kinda getting wrecked by weather yesterday night 😂

I did figure out that numberpad 7 gives you the weather report though!! Just had to find out what weather mod this thing used and what the key was for it in mcm


[12/8/2025 11:14 AM] nahraz
Is radiation sickness at the start kinda a death sentence? Havent found a way to cure it


[12/8/2025 11:41 AM] moth_love
I think you need cleansing tonics to cure radiation poisoning


[12/8/2025 11:41 AM] eltren.
is it normal that i have small weird physic glitch due to having 120 fps even with high fps mod fix?


[12/8/2025 1:27 PM] nahraz
thanks! do you know how i can escape my first (tbh i dont know what it is) -> i am scrapping sanctuary, then all of a sudden radboy says something about radiation then my geiger counter spiked to +35 rad or so and i cant do a thing about it. tried going indoors.


[12/8/2025 1:29 PM] nahraz
well actually it wasnt really "indoors" it was inside a house but not with a loading screen. do i need to find something with a loading screen?


[12/8/2025 1:30 PM] moth_love
As far as I can tell in this modpack, interior cells and only "clear" weather have clean, breathable air. There should've been a gas mask in the vault for you to put on.


[12/8/2025 1:30 PM] nahraz
the gas mask didnt help, it felt like a radiation storm


[12/8/2025 1:31 PM] moth_love
did you put a new filter in it? I've had a couple cases where I grab a mask off of a raider or body and there wasnt a filter in it


[12/8/2025 1:31 PM] nahraz
yes, was a fresh one


[12/8/2025 3:39 PM] dfeqz
Sanctuary has a root cellar you can sleep in to pass the time if you haven’t found a safe place, if not there’s a sewer tunnel right before red rocket on the road next to the broken down car


[12/8/2025 3:39 PM] dfeqz
The root cellar is behind one of the houses in sanctuary. It’s two houses to the right of the player home(facing the front of the houses)..iirc its another blue house


[12/8/2025 3:41 PM] dfeqz
Numperpad 7 to check the weather report


[12/8/2025 3:44 PM] kazifca
If you want an air filtration system so you can comfortably live outside look under power > misc


[12/8/2025 3:44 PM] kazifca
it should be the first option


[12/8/2025 3:44 PM] nahraz
thanks!


[12/8/2025 3:44 PM] kazifca
+35 rads is odd though, was your mask broken?


[12/8/2025 3:45 PM] kazifca
Like you generally would have to be maskless to hit those numbers or near a mini nuke going off or sumn shi


[12/8/2025 3:50 PM] zems
well i got it at the start


[12/8/2025 3:50 PM] kazifca
Like, I think the worst I got from a rad storm early with a mask on was +2 rads, so you may be dealing with a bug of some kind would be the first inclination


[12/8/2025 3:50 PM] nahraz
i believe the starting gas mask is not good against radiation, found another one with 750 def against it


[12/8/2025 3:51 PM] nahraz
that might have been it


[12/8/2025 3:51 PM] zems
i got like 5 debuff on my way into diamond city... it was difficult, however, its possible to reach the doctor before you die


[12/8/2025 3:52 PM] kazifca
Thats DR, the 750 mask is by far the best for def but the filter system acts as a seperate entity from my experience so far


[12/8/2025 3:52 PM] nahraz
750 against radiation, the other one had zero


[12/8/2025 3:52 PM] kazifca
Medicine, and barter need to have 1 rank in the perk you get from leveling the skill and you can build a doc


[12/8/2025 3:54 PM] kazifca
Thats rough, I'm not sure how much RAD DR plays into the actual filtration system, but I use a 50DR mask for aesthetics, rarely run into that issue unless I forget to reapply a filter


[12/8/2025 3:55 PM] kazifca
If you had a filter, mask not broken, not sick, I would assume its some kinda mishap with the current information available


[12/8/2025 3:56 PM] nahraz
ill keep an eye on it and maybe do a quick mask switch when the next storm hits


[12/8/2025 3:58 PM] kazifca
Definitely do, can't help anyone set up their game as mine was smooth as butter, I am a troubleshooter tho


[12/8/2025 4:16 PM] thisistotallysol
is the camera shake while walking intentional? only noticed it when holding pipe weapons, not the default .45. tho those are the only weapons i have right now, so cant really test yet if it's weapon specific


[12/8/2025 4:39 PM] kazifca
Thats base fallout


[12/8/2025 4:39 PM] kazifca
aggrevates me that they did that for like 5 weapons


[12/8/2025 4:42 PM] thisistotallysol
oh huh so it's just pipe weapons? man have i been playing modded fallout 4 for so long that i forgot that's a thing lol


[12/8/2025 4:43 PM] kazifca
Yeah, it throws me off whenever I pick up a weapon with the shake from pipe weapons


[12/8/2025 4:47 PM] thisistotallysol
i wonder if any of the animation mods make it worse here, i dont remember it being that bad

[12/8/2025 4:58 PM] arii5579
quick question, might be dumb. Im assuming after the installation process is complete it's OK to delete all the stuff in the "downloads" folders? (The zip files)


[12/8/2025 4:59 PM] arii5579
to save space ^


[12/8/2025 5:02 PM] kazifca
unless you have set something up to read from your downloads folder & everything else is where it should be, you should be fine


[12/8/2025 5:02 PM] arii5579
ok thank you


[12/8/2025 5:33 PM] nahraz
tested it with the googles with high rad resi, i still die due to 40+ rads/s.. the warning weather:radioactive comes and then i have about 5 sec before it goes up to 40


[12/8/2025 5:39 PM] kazifca
Yeah, that definitely odd, I'm not sure why you're getting gassed with the mask on, you've done all the basics? restarting, proper video card settings, etc?


[12/8/2025 5:39 PM] nahraz
everything else works perfectly


[12/8/2025 5:40 PM] kazifca
Weird, hug the tunnels, use the metro's till you can figure it out


[12/8/2025 5:41 PM] kazifca
Should keep you rad free and you can start right at concord


[12/8/2025 5:43 PM] nahraz
ok so in your game, if you get the signal weater:radiation you pop up your gasmask and everything is fine?


[12/8/2025 5:44 PM] kazifca
I never take my mask off


[12/8/2025 5:44 PM] kazifca
It's always irradiated outside as far as I've experienced on the harder difficulties


[12/8/2025 5:45 PM] nahraz
i might have found my problem 👶


[12/8/2025 5:45 PM] kazifca
LOL


[12/8/2025 5:45 PM] nahraz
i thought the fresh masks you find have a filter in them and the 0% is the percentage for "used up" filter


[12/8/2025 5:46 PM] kazifca
OH GOD


[12/8/2025 5:46 PM] kazifca
NO BROTHER


[12/8/2025 5:46 PM] kazifca
I SEE NOW LOL


[12/8/2025 5:46 PM] nahraz
as i have never had a funtioning gas mask i did not know it is the other way around xD


[12/8/2025 5:46 PM] nahraz
i am a paragon of survival


[12/8/2025 5:46 PM] kazifca
your percentile will drop, around 5 percent and below the game should literally be unplayable visually


[12/8/2025 5:47 PM] kazifca
So goddamn blurry


[12/8/2025 5:47 PM] nahraz
so fyi you can look through a gas mask without a filter perfectly fine 😂


[12/8/2025 5:48 PM] kazifca
Good to know, good to know


[12/8/2025 5:56 PM] nahraz
have you found the option to upgrade your weapon dmg by up to 90% for no materials at all? is that (dont know how to call it) an "open" option of the mod.. something that you should not use if you want an immersive playthrough?


[12/8/2025 5:57 PM] kazifca
I mean, if you shoot most things in the head beyond wildlife it'll die


[12/8/2025 5:57 PM] nahraz
yea, was just asking myself the question why the option is there at all


[12/8/2025 5:57 PM] kazifca
Just included in a mod, also useful later in the game


[12/8/2025 5:57 PM] kazifca
running 4 different shotguns spec'd out for different ranges and a anti-mat rifle


[12/8/2025 5:58 PM] nahraz
but goes kinda in the cheaty direction doesnt it?


[12/8/2025 5:58 PM] kazifca
Well, it's fallout


[12/8/2025 5:58 PM] kazifca
I wouldn't exactly put the game down as incredibly difficult to begin with


[12/8/2025 5:58 PM] kazifca
If you feel like you're getting ruined or aren't comfortable clicking heads, use it


[12/8/2025 5:59 PM] kazifca
who cares


[12/8/2025 5:59 PM] nahraz
true


[12/8/2025 5:59 PM] kazifca
Play it how you wanna play it brotha


[12/8/2025 6:00 PM] kazifca
To also be fair, if you're smart with it you can have like 7 unique effects on a weapon


[12/8/2025 6:00 PM] kazifca
5 of them being legendary (I've only got 7 so far on my tacticool shotgun)


[12/8/2025 6:01 PM] kazifca
But five legendary effects, double the mag size of a standard police riot, and better handing, it's pretty strong


[12/8/2025 6:01 PM] kazifca
Throw the EMC slugs? I think they're called, adds explosive & energy damage


[12/8/2025 6:02 PM] kazifca
Not many things that thing doesn't ruin in its general vicinity


[12/8/2025 6:03 PM] kazifca
if those 5 legendary effects are directly related to crit & fire-rate, you can luck stack by level 10-15 and start critting with all your shotguns, because of the supporting perks from YAE (you are exceptional)


[12/8/2025 6:05 PM] kazifca
so like, rapid, lucky, explosive, the AP refill on crit effect, and theres one that improves accuracy at the cost of something


[12/8/2025 6:05 PM] kazifca
You'll basically be unstoppable as long as you don't get shot in the head


[12/8/2025 6:07 PM] nahraz
Yea, am really hyped to explore everything the mod Pack has to offer. Concord alone is a completely new experience


[12/8/2025 6:09 PM] kazifca
You can also get like a huge sneak attack multiplier on that lmao, the thing is disgusting. 
Concord was definitely a far more enjoyable experience (for me) in the mod pack as opposed to base game. I'm also a fan of the CRPGs so the more brutal it is the better

How can you unlock the pistol ammo recipes for the ammo bench


[12/9/2025 1:44 AM] kazifca
You should just be able to spend generally 100 (sometimes a different amount) of an ammo at a engineering bench to make the schematic

Anyone know how i cure the light rad poisoning debuff


[12/9/2025 5:58 AM] streikeizer
Doctor or IRA/rad away.


[12/9/2025 5:58 AM] streikeizer
Or whatever cures rad poisioning


[12/9/2025 5:59 AM] frosty0898
Anyone else have an issue where a weapon will randomly lose 50% of its damage?


[12/9/2025 6:05 AM] cbsgaming
does any doctor work


[12/9/2025 6:44 AM] nahraz
allthough i am chugging  Ca-DTPA (the one that reduces RAD and IRA) i cannot seem to get my RAD under a certain threshold... it stays at 1 and half bar lower left corner (green bars) does anyone know why?


[12/9/2025 7:10 AM] streikeizer
Should be

Is there a faster way into the railroad hq


[12/9/2025 12:21 PM] _askman
looks like this was caused by the settler built settlments plan for sunshine tidings co-op. Removing just the plan fixed the issue. I'd not cleared the settlement yet so wondering if it's something to do with that


[12/9/2025 12:32 PM] _askman
I know SBS isn't included in anomaly but I've seen it mentioned by some people so thought worth mentioning in case anyone else has the issue

would low LOD overlapping with high quality up close be a previs issue?


[12/9/2025 4:23 PM] thisistotallysol
tested this in vanilla and in another modlist, yeah this is WAY more shaking than the pipe rifles have


[12/9/2025 4:51 PM] menumorutziscrapusaumenuthotep
Do i need to keep all the mods in the 'downloads' section or can I delete them?


[12/9/2025 4:52 PM] menumorutziscrapusaumenuthotep
they use up over 130GB

how to upgrade your gunsmith skill past the lvl 2? i have lvled up 3 times the perk(i have 50 points in gunsmith) and i only can use 2nd lvl modifications


[12/10/2025 2:05 AM] kazifca
Just keep putting points into it, I'm pretty sure the next upgrade is at 85

[12/10/2025 10:56 AM] knifewizzerd
and how to move that li'l paper doll?


[12/10/2025 11:27 AM] admiralkobi
Only way I've found is to open up the in game command panel (Mine is defaulted to the tilde key just below the Esc key in the upper left corner of the keyboard) and then do the following command:
savegame [your save]
Example: savegame kobi

This lets me quickly save the game and then and overrite as needed or make various hardsave points with different names.


[12/10/2025 11:52 AM] georgebodge
@Kobi  thankyou i will give that a try when im next on!

For the current pack there is not.

Eizer and I are hard at work on something that we feel the community will enjoy however.

Not sure if this is where to ask. Install went well, but when i launch from MO2, i briefly see the ENB text on a black screen, then the game closes

My anomaly says it’s unable to download a fallout4.ccc and a whole bunch of other ones and when I try to click on the links in show missing archives it says “missing files”


[12/11/2025 2:05 PM] married_

last question I put it in my modlist folder?


[12/11/2025 3:34 PM] married_
Try just putting it in your fallout 4 local files first and if wabbajack is still giving you issues with it then yeah put it in the downloads file of the modlist


[12/11/2025 3:50 PM] the1above_all
I just put them in my overall fallout 4 game on steam and the modlist still not working do I have to do the whole folder or just d3dd11.dll d3dcompiler_46e.dll


[12/11/2025 3:51 PM] married_
when you tried to install anomaly for the first time it should've made a folder inside of your anomaly folder called downloads with everything that did download through wabbajack.


[12/11/2025 3:53 PM] the1above_all
yea all the downloads from wabbajack are in there


[12/11/2025 3:55 PM] the1above_all

How do I equip the power armor? I started with it but I can't seem to equip it


[12/12/2025 3:53 PM] mariathewitchaddict
You need a frame to put the PA on, which you need PA training to use


[12/12/2025 3:56 PM] mariathewitchaddict
Earliest possible point I could think of to learn PA training would be the BoS, since they're the only major faction that actually uses it.


[12/12/2025 3:57 PM] kazifca
If you’re in a rush, I’m not sure if everyone’s APC has it but mine had Quincy off the bat, if that’s your case go to Quincy and talk to the Atom cats


[12/12/2025 3:57 PM] mariathewitchaddict
Though this list has so many new enemies that I'm not sure if other factions get PA now. I mag dumped a broken-down synth in the middle of concord because it scared the shit out of me when it suddenly got up


[12/12/2025 3:57 PM] kazifca
You gotta deliver a pump and fight off a bunch of gunners


[12/12/2025 3:58 PM] kazifca
Drop 1k caps and you can get trained


[12/12/2025 3:59 PM] mariathewitchaddict
Personally I'm a fan of the BoS because the questline gives you a full suit of T-60 (assuming the questline is the same as vanilla)


[12/12/2025 3:59 PM] kazifca
I just don’t like most of the factions in fallout 4 😭🤣


[12/12/2025 3:59 PM] kazifca
Atom cats are pretty chill dudes though


[12/12/2025 4:00 PM] mariathewitchaddict
Maxon can do all the war crimes he wants, I just want the armour and a shop that has all of my PA and laser needs


[12/12/2025 4:00 PM] kazifca
Nah that guy gotta get smacked every play through


[12/12/2025 4:01 PM] kazifca
Bro was a shi kid and a mid leader


[12/12/2025 4:01 PM] mariathewitchaddict
The Institute is tempting for its free healthcare, but it's also the weakest narrative faction in the game.


[12/12/2025 4:02 PM] mariathewitchaddict
That being said, vanilla is incredibly funny when you start throwing synth grenades at all of your problems


[12/12/2025 4:04 PM] solaire7723
lmao I picked a shitty start then


[12/12/2025 4:04 PM] kazifca
That’s fair, I’d say all of them are pretty eh. The railroad could’ve been so many leagues better and is the potential man of the game, the minute men are cool but are seriously dampened by the direct correlation to radiant quests and the lack of driving narrative, the brotherhood is just the enclave 2.0 but we don’t shoot people on first sight, and the institute, well they’re nerds


[12/12/2025 4:08 PM] mariathewitchaddict
Quite literally the minutemen would have been the best faction if they actually had a main story narrative


[12/12/2025 4:09 PM] mariathewitchaddict
Yeah I picked the atom cat start before in a different list, YAE doesn't give you a frame for the PA though, which is incredibly weird.


[12/12/2025 4:12 PM] mariathewitchaddict
I settled for not picking up any PA I find because it's literally dead weight unless I can get trained


[12/12/2025 4:13 PM] kazifca
Well they defined them as simply settlement protectors, I find it more offensive that if you choose the minutemen ending nothing actually comes of it. No serious-post game quests like rebuilding some governing body, or seeing a serious landscape dynamic change beyond the occasional patrol and my supply lines


[12/12/2025 4:14 PM] mariathewitchaddict
The minutemen ending just feels like you did the BoS ending but in a way that screws you over with the BoS and leaves you with no post-narrative


[12/12/2025 4:17 PM] mariathewitchaddict
BoS get really upset that they couldn't kill the civilian scientists


[12/12/2025 4:22 PM] kazifca
My issue with Maxson is he’s literally still a child, hilariously narrow perspective, hypocritical, and can’t fault the obvious issue without involving everyone who had been disaffected by the issue in a negative way


[12/12/2025 4:22 PM] kazifca
Like, the enclave 😭


[12/12/2025 4:25 PM] mariathewitchaddict
The Enclave is at least interesting because it's just comically evil and never at any point does it make you feel like supporting them might be a good idea.


[12/12/2025 4:26 PM] kazifca
An enclave play through is actually funny and not just mis matched ideological jangle


[12/12/2025 4:26 PM] mariathewitchaddict
It's also kinda crazy that the Enclave wasn't featured in FO4 given that the male protagonist's military background could have made them gravitate towards it in a way that's in-character.


[12/12/2025 4:26 PM] solaire7723
how do I turn on quick saves btw?


[12/12/2025 4:26 PM] kazifca
No clue but cigarettes work


[12/12/2025 4:26 PM] mariathewitchaddict
You don't. Survival Mode.


[12/12/2025 4:27 PM] mariathewitchaddict
Only way to save is bed, cigarettes, or the survival kit (game sometimes autosaves but never trust an autosave in bethesda games)


[12/12/2025 4:27 PM] kazifca
The cig autosaves are definitely trustworthy


[12/12/2025 4:28 PM] kazifca
I have been counting on my cigarettes for so much never ran into a mishap frfr


[12/12/2025 4:29 PM] kazifca
Also, point lookout seems to work which is incredibly swag


[12/12/2025 4:30 PM] solaire7723
thank you


[12/12/2025 4:30 PM] solaire7723
Lastly, stupid question maybe, How do I heal individual bodyparts


[12/12/2025 4:31 PM] kazifca
There’s a few options, and not a stupid question there’s a lotta shit


[12/12/2025 4:31 PM] kazifca
Sam splints, IFAKs, and Doctors bags are amazing


[12/12/2025 4:31 PM] kazifca
Doctors bags are classic problem solver and in this game, amusingly light


[12/12/2025 4:32 PM] mariathewitchaddict
I've also found that making sure you have a plate stops you from taking any major damage when things do hit you


[12/12/2025 4:33 PM] kazifca
Man I remember to replace those


[12/12/2025 4:33 PM] kazifca
They are definitely useful af I just be forgetting


[12/12/2025 4:33 PM] mariathewitchaddict
Plate and helmet pretty much saves your life


[12/12/2025 4:33 PM] kazifca
Helmets are the requirement you cannot live without


[12/12/2025 4:33 PM] kazifca
You will die if you are shot in the head


[12/12/2025 4:33 PM] kazifca
You are not the courier in Boston


[12/12/2025 4:34 PM] mariathewitchaddict
Juggernaut Plate is funny if you can get it because it's like 400 ballistic resist


[12/12/2025 4:34 PM] kazifca
Heavy


[12/12/2025 4:34 PM] kazifca
Also only like 12 shots of it


[12/12/2025 4:35 PM] kazifca
I don’t get hit a lot so I find those ones just take up space


[12/12/2025 4:35 PM] mariathewitchaddict
That's 12 shots that won't kill or severely injure you if you're in a tight spot


[12/12/2025 4:36 PM] mariathewitchaddict
Some enemies are kinda dumb though. I watched four raiders consecutively jump from their vantage point and break their legs


[12/12/2025 4:36 PM] kazifca
There’s times


[12/12/2025 4:36 PM] kazifca
I usually just wear power armour to a tight spot ngl


[12/12/2025 4:37 PM] kazifca
Lynx set with the advanced PA helmet because the lynx overlay is

I went to codsworth and radiation killed me lol


[12/12/2025 4:38 PM] solaire7723
I will have to watch a few guides before playing this


[12/12/2025 4:39 PM] kazifca
Put on your gas mask


[12/12/2025 4:39 PM] kazifca
Go into aid


[12/12/2025 4:39 PM] kazifca
And select the gas mask filter


[12/12/2025 4:40 PM] kazifca
I would recommend changing your time from like 3minutes to 5-8 in MO2


[12/12/2025 4:40 PM] kazifca
Or well your in game mod config


[12/12/2025 4:52 PM] solaire7723
Thanks I did just that


[12/12/2025 4:52 PM] solaire7723
I am sorry for question bombing guys


[12/12/2025 5:03 PM] kazifca

[12/12/2025 5:16 PM] solaire7723
Anomaly seems so dark


[12/12/2025 5:20 PM] kazifca
No clue I love the dark aspect


[12/12/2025 5:20 PM] mariathewitchaddict
Darkness helps with stealth


[12/12/2025 5:20 PM] mariathewitchaddict
Stealth is important to not get riddled with bullets in the early game


[12/12/2025 5:21 PM] mariathewitchaddict
I think I tried about 6 times to get through concord with force before just going solid snake on the raiders

You need to downgrade the game manually to 1.10.984.0


[12/14/2025 12:14 AM] boomcha_10185
man i expect painless one click install and boom, but what i experienced is AE, NG downgrade, enb setpuku iteself shitstrom. better be worth it i pray

it is worth it

https://discord.com/channels/1113971680419782666/1436439089502224496
Here. Just in case, 
 you should downgrade your fallout version to NG, and download old files(not just delta patch), too.


[12/14/2025 3:57 AM] aceisbased.
could you elaborate on the downgrade? do you mean the latest anniversary update isn't the version I should use?


[12/14/2025 4:06 AM] proletar191
had to downgrade but now im stuck on enb haha


[12/14/2025 4:26 AM] boomcha_10185
okay
1. clean install. of course purge everything in steam folder, too, and delete my documents\my games\fallout 4, also.
2. install clean fallout 4 via steam. it will install as AE version.
3. downgrade fallout 4(from AE to NG version). check this https://discord.com/channels/1113971680419782666/1439282732860706816/1439317937864311125
4. run that downgraded fallout 4 one time, without any mod, via steam. 
5. download enb somthing file from here https://discord.com/channels/1113971680419782666/1441627598387019932/1446026668128075890, (it will lead you to another site, and you copy paste web address into your browser. it will start download that file)and put that in wabajack fallout 4 anomaly download folder beforehand. wabajack doesn't download proper file some reason.
6. run wabajack and install fallout anomaly. -> else goes as what supposed to.

[12/14/2025 4:53 AM] boomcha_10185

Hey, is the stalker gas mask  supposed to not be integrated with the gas mask mods, it looks really cool and is the highest rad resistance one that i have found that also does not cover the glasses slot or helmet slot and i would really like to use with night vision googles


[12/15/2025 3:36 PM] just_tucho
I read in the page something about repairing weapons and armor but i dont know how to check, how broken the the guns are (Armor appears to be shown in the hud) nor how to repair them when they get damaged


[12/15/2025 4:14 PM] kazifca
use the gas mask database manager in your aid section, and put the stalker mask into the container


[12/15/2025 4:14 PM] kazifca
Haven't had to repair gear once, don't worry about it


[12/15/2025 4:15 PM] just_tucho
Thank you  man


[12/15/2025 4:15 PM] kazifca
Stalker mask is aesthetically heat I get it


[12/15/2025 4:15 PM] just_tucho
Also night vision


[12/15/2025 4:15 PM] kazifca
No clue, don't use it


[12/15/2025 4:15 PM] kazifca
I play in the pitch black


[12/15/2025 4:16 PM] just_tucho
I got one early and it feels like cheating at night


[12/15/2025 4:17 PM] just_tucho
I havent used it enough however unless it requires some kind of energy to power it it is probably kinda broken


[12/15/2025 4:17 PM] just_tucho
But it would be really hard to implement it using energy cells


[12/15/2025 4:17 PM] just_tucho
So it probably doesnt


[12/15/2025 4:17 PM] just_tucho
But it would be so cool


[12/15/2025 4:18 PM] kazifca
I'll probably use night vision on my next play through, I added the boston riot armor to the game, which has night vision functions built into some of the pieces


[12/15/2025 4:18 PM] kazifca
But that'll be a bum rush set up


[12/15/2025 4:20 PM] just_tucho
Man i would love to add the  FNV ranger helmet as a strong helmet that is both a gas mask  and has night vision but weighs a considerable amount (for a helmet) and while having great protection hasnt got THE best protection, just like A-S tier  protection


[12/15/2025 4:21 PM] just_tucho
But I dont have the skills to do that


[12/15/2025 4:21 PM] just_tucho
I could learn


[12/15/2025 4:21 PM] kazifca
Boston riot armor


[12/15/2025 4:22 PM] kazifca
Add one of the helmets to the database


[12/15/2025 4:22 PM] kazifca
Got, what 4 unique sets, and a base set


[12/15/2025 4:22 PM] kazifca
Plenty of options to work with


[12/15/2025 4:22 PM] just_tucho
It is in the modlist?


[12/15/2025 4:22 PM] kazifca
No


[12/15/2025 4:23 PM] kazifca
But it should work just fine in your unorganized section


[12/15/2025 4:23 PM] kazifca
SHOULD don’t quote me


[12/15/2025 4:23 PM] kazifca
Works perfectly for me


[12/15/2025 4:24 PM] just_tucho
I cant believe that as a certified game developer Kazifca said that  Boston riot armor works perfectly with Fallout anomally without any tinkering


[12/15/2025 4:24 PM] kazifca

[12/16/2025 6:28 PM] n0stic.
got it to work, downloaded a file from the support forum


[12/17/2025 4:46 AM] gibraltar9020
Howdy!


[12/17/2025 5:46 AM] tiburse
This is due to Boris (the creator of ENB) updating thir files without releasing a new version. Every change they make it requires a complete rebuild/recompile of the current pack version.


[12/17/2025 5:47 AM] tiburse
Thanks for posting this, I was asleep and got up and went to work.


[12/17/2025 5:48 AM] renvy.kobold
can anyone help, pls?


[12/17/2025 5:48 AM] crmsnrd
of course, it helped me so why not have it help all others


[12/17/2025 5:49 AM] tiburse
Check your sound settings both in the settings audio, but also the MCM setting for persistant volume sliders. My access is currently limited as I am at work.


[12/17/2025 5:50 AM] renvy.kobold
in setting and in MCM all is on, moving sliders doesn't help.


[12/17/2025 5:58 AM] tiburse
Do you have a "3d sound" feature on your headphones?


[12/17/2025 5:58 AM] tiburse
Like a 5.1 or 7.1 where it emulates surround sound?


[12/17/2025 5:58 AM] tiburse
If so turn that off.


[12/17/2025 5:58 AM] tiburse
Fallout 4 is old af and does not play well with that.


[12/17/2025 6:05 AM] renvy.kobold
doesn't help too


[12/17/2025 6:44 AM] tiburse
What do you have for a sound device?


[12/17/2025 7:05 AM] renvy.kobold
headphones


[12/17/2025 7:05 AM] tiburse
What kind?


[12/17/2025 7:06 AM] renvy.kobold
sennheiser gsp 300


[12/17/2025 7:07 AM] renvy.kobold
over-ear


[12/17/2025 7:07 AM] tiburse
Do you connect with a DAC or through the 3.5mm motherboard connector?


[12/17/2025 7:07 AM] renvy.kobold
through 3.5 mm


[12/17/2025 7:19 AM] d2icarus
So is the modpack actually dead or was that announcement about ending development just a knee jerk reaction to the FO4 update? Cuz it looks like there's still updates being made to the modpack.


[12/17/2025 7:20 AM] tiburse
Moving to DM to not clog ch


[12/17/2025 7:21 AM] tiburse
Its not dead, the updates that Nomad is making is just to keep the current pack alive. Eizer and I are currently working on a spiritual successor to the pack.


[12/17/2025 7:22 AM] tiburse
Adding in some much needed settlement stuff and some of the most requested mods.


[12/17/2025 7:22 AM] tiburse
While also trying to keep it lore friendly.


[12/17/2025 7:23 AM] d2icarus
Ah, so keeping the bottlecaps instead of using the Metro bullets? lol


[12/17/2025 7:37 AM] gibraltar9020
There's a dialogue box I can't exit when i start the game. It's the one that says "the wasteland is unforgiving rate us on nexus etc etc" but no matter what i do or what button i press it doesn't close. Anyone know why this is happening?


[12/17/2025 8:28 AM] tiburse
That and a few other things.


[12/17/2025 8:29 AM] tiburse
Did you add any mods?

somehow looksmenu not working, tried reinstall but same


[12/17/2025 9:24 AM] djbreadandbutter
I just wish could play but ive tried installing twice and manually  downgrading so im just gonna wait till the downgrading is fixed if it can be.


[12/17/2025 9:37 AM] crmsnrd
What isnt working with downgrading?


[12/17/2025 9:38 AM] djbreadandbutter
Well I replace all the files manually  but im still missing files somehow


[12/17/2025 9:38 AM] djbreadandbutter
After the installl


[12/17/2025 9:39 AM] djbreadandbutter
Install takes forever so I just stopped after 2 retrys


[12/17/2025 9:42 AM] crmsnrd
What files specifically? The Downgrade guide i sent up top has all the main files, but I had to also get the files for creation club


[12/17/2025 9:43 AM] djbreadandbutter
Im currently  working so I cant really check nor do i have  any of it installed


[12/17/2025 9:43 AM] crmsnrd
Before that I was missing files, so what I did was download and downgrade the main files, then download the creation club/kit files, then place the main fallout file again to overwrite


[12/17/2025 9:43 AM] crmsnrd
When you get home, if you want to try again, try that, it fixed all the missing files for me


[12/17/2025 9:43 AM] djbreadandbutter
I just know I download  depot files


[12/17/2025 9:43 AM] djbreadandbutter
Downloaded*


[12/17/2025 9:43 AM] crmsnrd
Yep, i gotchu.


[12/17/2025 9:44 AM] djbreadandbutter
Replaced those and still had issues. Think the second. Install actually  was messing up on normal mods also for some reason. Be nice if Bethesda  just left their games alone


[12/17/2025 9:45 AM] crmsnrd
You replaced all the files, yet still lacked files?


[12/17/2025 9:45 AM] djbreadandbutter
Correct


[12/17/2025 9:45 AM] crmsnrd
You may have missed some then. Did you downgrade from own knowledge or from a guide?


[12/17/2025 9:45 AM] djbreadandbutter
A list someone posted i just followed it


[12/17/2025 9:46 AM] crmsnrd
This one?


[12/17/2025 9:46 AM] crmsnrd
The post here is missing the creation kit files, so it would make sense you were missing some files if you have that installed


[12/17/2025 9:47 AM] djbreadandbutter
The post here is the one I followed yeah


[12/17/2025 9:47 AM] djbreadandbutter
Probally it then for sure


[12/17/2025 9:47 AM] crmsnrd
Yep, ight then I think i can help you!


[12/17/2025 9:47 AM] crmsnrd
Let me see if I can find the other post I followed that includes the rest of the files


[12/17/2025 9:47 AM] crmsnrd
give me a moment, then when you get home you can install those and then everything should work


[12/17/2025 9:49 AM] djbreadandbutter
I got the a pack of the fallout sodas  so it got me wanting to play again xd would be much appreciated

I reckon you have that installed, so try that later when youre home from work!


[12/17/2025 9:49 AM] djbreadandbutter
I see I see.


[12/17/2025 9:49 AM] crmsnrd
Feel free to ping me if u run into any issues, and Ill see if i can help!


[12/17/2025 9:50 AM] djbreadandbutter
Yeah appercaite the help the mod pack looks super cool only other packs ive done are london  and iw2


[12/17/2025 9:53 AM] crmsnrd
yeah, having a blast playing it rn, its rough and brutal but enjoyable experience


[12/17/2025 9:53 AM] djbreadandbutter
I play tarkov cant be worse than that right xd


[12/17/2025 9:55 AM] crmsnrd
Well, its not necessarily worse, but its much different to normal fallout. Its very unforgiving and if you play on survival like its intended theres no saving unless you find a bed


[12/17/2025 9:55 AM] crmsnrd
You cant really go in blasting a gun, you will die.


[12/17/2025 9:59 AM] djbreadandbutter
Makes sense sounds fun to me


[12/17/2025 12:59 PM] tiburse
You can save if you smoke a cigarette or use a survival pack


[12/17/2025 12:59 PM] crmsnrd
holy, are they reusable?


[12/17/2025 1:00 PM] tiburse
they are not but you can craft more survival packs on the chem bench and cigs are plentiful


[12/17/2025 1:00 PM] tiburse
I had over 600 of them by the time I cleared corvega


[12/17/2025 1:21 PM] theyodelingyeet
given my searches from within the discord, im assumed VAFS doesnt work right now? cause when I press the keybind it just makes the vats click sound but i cant even lock onto anyone

is there a way to undo the restrictions on cheat terminal?


[12/17/2025 3:48 PM] gibraltar9020
i like running a legit and a cheat save side by side


[12/17/2025 3:54 PM] mariathewitchaddict
I have a weird feeling that normal cheat terminal could screw with other mods, but I'm not a modder


[12/17/2025 3:57 PM] gibraltar9020
i figured as such but i just wanted to check


[12/17/2025 3:58 PM] gibraltar9020
with how sensitive mods are inherently and even worse in modpacks i wouldnt be surprised. i hope its not some tyrannical aim at restricting player autonomy in literal fallout 4 though


[12/17/2025 3:58 PM] gibraltar9020
cause that would just be lame


[12/17/2025 3:59 PM] gibraltar9020
like "hey heres a sandbox but you can only play with the sand the way i tell you to and if you dont like it then leave"


[12/17/2025 3:59 PM] mariathewitchaddict
From my experience in using cheat terminal, it tends to use vanilla names for everything. So, say you have mods that replace ammo types, cheat terminal could only give you the vanilla ammo types instead of any modded ones.


[12/17/2025 4:01 PM] gibraltar9020
yeah that makes a lot of sense


[12/17/2025 4:01 PM] gibraltar9020
if i remember correctly cheat terminal just runs console commands basically so if all the commands got changed then theres no way of making it work im pretty sure


[12/17/2025 4:15 PM] wonderbread6689
what is the closest power armour trainer?


[12/17/2025 7:17 PM] theyodelingyeet
anyone know if theres a way to just disable the gask mask overlay? Or would i just have to disable the whole mod


[12/17/2025 7:20 PM] theyodelingyeet
nvm i did not realize you could change the overlay on the given holotape


[12/17/2025 7:42 PM] king_bunta
Hello everyone was hoping to get some insight as I’m having really only 2 issues at this time. 
1) my gas masks randomly de equip themselves causing very fast deaths and not sure why, has any one else experienced this or know how to make it stop?
2) my key binds seem to randomly stop working or haven’t worked since I started (j to holster weapon hasn’t worked since I started playing) and randomly will just lose keys or mouse control for clicking in pip boy. Is there a way to reset or stop this issue? 
Thanks! Sorry posted in support and havent seen anything relating to it there


[12/17/2025 10:38 PM] enyosverd

they're different but im not sure where to go from herer


[12/18/2025 3:11 AM] tiburse
Thats because FO4 updated again. Need to wait on wabbajack to update to a version that lets it downgrade the base game from that. Or if you search discord for depot, you can download the files from steam depot and do it manually.


[12/18/2025 3:19 AM] enyosverd
i downloaded the steam depot files and put them into the right areas


[12/18/2025 3:19 AM] enyosverd
thats the thing


[12/18/2025 3:20 AM] tiburse
Ill need to figure out what version wabba is looking for


[12/18/2025 3:22 AM] kazifca
unrelated to the current subject, but ally, would the modpack you guys were working on be more difficult or easier would you say?


[12/18/2025 3:22 AM] kazifca
I was looking for like bronze bull levels of torture


[12/18/2025 4:22 AM] tiburse
Its gonna be about the same once it ramps to full release.


[12/18/2025 4:23 AM] tiburse
Radiation will be a tad more forgiving due to additional mods


[12/18/2025 4:32 AM] kazifca
hmmm okok


[12/18/2025 5:41 AM] tiburse
Other than that expect the same from combat, with rougher random encounters.


[12/18/2025 6:14 AM] streikeizer
Tbh If anything its diffrent. We use some old ideas, some new ideas. Its the same in terms of combat as anomaly. but some major systems will be diffrent. Its pretty bare bones right now. but what's in, is fairly difficult lets say. But you should have more options in terms of equipement than before. And maybe even if we get it to work proper a Melee/Unarmed option aswell.


[12/18/2025 6:37 AM] kazifca
If you ran a nightperson (I forgot the perk name) build you could do melee pretty early on, just had to be comically cautious. 
No I'm tryina have like disgustingly large hordes of ghouls, being hunted, temp mechanics, shit send packs of deathclaws after me, chameleon ones at that, I'm tryina suffer fr


[12/18/2025 6:37 AM] kazifca
Ontop of anomaly combat


[12/18/2025 6:37 AM] kazifca
god I should learn how to mod


[12/18/2025 6:39 AM] kazifca
Like I love anomaly combat, but after I'd say level 25, only really like super mutants with missile launchers haunt my dreams


[12/18/2025 6:42 AM] streikeizer
Yeah thats the thing we are going to try and tackle. Pretty hard ngl with how fallout 4 works at its base. But we have some ideas. In terms of random encounters. Not sure how tho. But lets say they start at base lvl 25. And scale with the player. Not sure how that would work out but we'll see.


[12/18/2025 6:42 AM] kazifca
The infestations mod would be a fun start, not sure how compatible it is


[12/18/2025 6:42 AM] streikeizer
Also some better weapons are gonna be quest locked once we figure that out.


[12/18/2025 6:42 AM] kazifca
FGEP is nifty looking too


[12/18/2025 6:43 AM] kazifca
Boston riot armor!! that mod is cool as hell


[12/18/2025 6:43 AM] streikeizer
I mean we ran that once. Both actually. But they are massive for script bloat and stuff


[12/18/2025 6:43 AM] kazifca
Aw dang


[12/18/2025 6:43 AM] kazifca
fair enough fair enough


[12/18/2025 6:43 AM] kazifca
That bomber suit is absolutely rad


[12/18/2025 6:44 AM] kazifca
Ranger rifle is also cool, though I would definitely lock the unique behind a quest with ECO and LEO


[12/18/2025 6:44 AM] streikeizer
I mean this is whats in and implemented on factions atm in terms of armor.

AKs of the Wasteland (Chinese Assault Rifle - Galil - AKs Pack)
This mod adds, 3 guns, the AK, the Galil and the Type 93 (Fo3 chinese assault rifle) into the game, but with a twist... as a weapon platform. So you can mix and match each of them into the most BLESS,

Nah but FR There is alot to be done. in terms of enemies allies and such. with the implementation of weapons via faction quests. They will mostly be 1 of a kind. And fitted to the faction you get em from.


[12/18/2025 6:47 AM] kazifca
Only mod that had a shotgun with an actual laser sight :todd_howard:  (that I could find in game, I may have missed one)


[12/18/2025 6:48 AM] streikeizer
Wahha I think the spas is the most op weapon in anomaly.


[12/18/2025 6:48 AM] kazifca
Really?


[12/18/2025 6:48 AM] kazifca
I found it like, mid


[12/18/2025 6:48 AM] streikeizer
I mean you can get it at lvl 1. and carries you all game if you spec into shotguns.


[12/18/2025 6:48 AM] kazifca

[12/18/2025 6:49 AM] kazifca
they might need some tuning I'm ngl


[12/18/2025 6:49 AM] streikeizer
But yeah. Its gonna be in big lines the same as anomaly. But alot diffrent in terms of setup.


[12/18/2025 6:50 AM] streikeizer
And you might want to run your least liked faction to get that one specific weapon you like.


[12/18/2025 6:50 AM] kazifca
Thats okay, I hate ALL the factions in fallout 4 equally


[12/18/2025 6:50 AM] streikeizer

Also 1 big change @Ally_J Brought into this mix is the implementation of a new classic. But you'll see that once its ready.:PepeLaugh:

Well im the goofiest of goobers, sat there for the best part of 2 weeks trying to make my own vertibird mod for a personal vertibird, patching into another mod just to fail and realise someone else already done this and implemented it way better. chat gpt made it seem like i was seconds away every single day to completing it.

I did learn a lot in ck though i guess if you can even call it that lol


[12/18/2025 11:46 AM] lornkastaar
Fallout4 just had an update. The mod author was waiting for Downgrader to update, and I believe it updated yesterday. There should be a new compile and update shortly along with a working wabbajack install at that point


[12/18/2025 11:46 AM] lornkastaar
Otherwise, you need to manually downgrade your F4 install and run the current wabbajack build


[12/18/2025 2:16 PM] jigsaw21101990
If I download game now and install it does anyone know how to downgrade it and install this modlist


[12/18/2025 4:26 PM] imfiredup26
download the newest version of webbajack and you will see if there


[12/18/2025 5:05 PM] jigsaw21101990
Thx i Will try that


[12/18/2025 5:06 PM] kazifca
I'm not sure if it would be script heavy, but maybe increasing the general amount of vicious wildlife might help, death claws should be in packs, could throw night stalkers in there and disperse them around the north of quincy/north eastern areas of the map & some facilities in the glowing sea. 
I'm not sure if changing spawn rates is literally hell on earth or not, but shifting wildlife to have more respawns, especially in the glowing sea would be a solid one too.


[12/18/2025 5:10 PM] kazifca
Could go pure evil and replace half the bloatflies in the game with Cazadors


[12/18/2025 5:11 PM] imfiredup26
as for downgrading there should be a video on YouTube also there official web sits goes through issue if Webb jacks fails to get mods


[12/18/2025 5:24 PM] tiburse
Packs of deathclaws you say. What if they see you but you cant see them hmmmm?


[12/18/2025 5:24 PM] tiburse
Dont read between the lines. Take that as it is.


[12/18/2025 5:24 PM] tiburse
Im also adding in other "fun" things.


[12/18/2025 5:24 PM] kazifca
Yeah man, send chameleons my way


[12/18/2025 5:25 PM] kazifca
I encourage it for the suffering and agony difficulty


[12/18/2025 5:25 PM] tiburse
Lets put it this way. How bout a single dog can put you down at this point.


[12/18/2025 5:25 PM] tiburse
I did nerf bloatflys into the ground due to the fact that I hate those fuckers. But there are other things you will need to worry about.


[12/18/2025 5:26 PM] kazifca
I mean, damage numbers weren't the issues, fallout 4's lack of consistently scary wildlife is ya know


[12/18/2025 5:26 PM] kazifca
but that IS me


[12/18/2025 5:26 PM] kazifca
I always found finding like 1-2 deathclaws at once such a silly thing


[12/18/2025 5:27 PM] kazifca
I still get shot in the head and die from non-super mutants, I'm just not scared of walking towards them with my shotgun ya know


[12/18/2025 5:32 PM] kazifca
give death claws molerat burrowing, lol


[12/18/2025 5:35 PM] tiburse
Sadly due to other mods burrowing has to be disable due to crashes related to the interaction with that and settlements.


[12/18/2025 5:36 PM] kazifca
Shucks, note for a different collection then


[12/18/2025 5:36 PM] kazifca
give ALL deathclaws burrowing capabilities and don't tell ANYONE


[12/18/2025 6:57 PM] tiburse
Oh I did note that lol.


[12/18/2025 6:57 PM] tiburse
If I can find a way around it I will. Problem is with them attacking settlements.


[12/18/2025 7:25 PM] imfiredup26
anyone know why i keep failing on the enb even tho i put in the downloads folder and keeps saying i dont have it when i do


[12/18/2025 8:02 PM] esinyaow

[12/19/2025 1:15 AM] ehsmkingwolf
do i have to downgrade to play this?


[12/19/2025 1:38 AM] kazifca
Yes


[12/19/2025 2:07 AM] rookebonwing
To what version?


[12/19/2025 2:12 AM] kazifca
1.10.980, I think? I'm not sure I downloaded it literally at the perfect time


[12/19/2025 2:44 AM] nora435_60449
Heyy


[12/19/2025 4:51 AM] puraaj
howdy


[12/19/2025 5:21 AM] streikeizer
1.10.980 yeah. The hashes are still for that version.


[12/19/2025 6:04 AM] kazifca
Ay, do you know any ENB's that would play nicely with the vulkan renderer, tried to do a combo earlier, and lets just say we're fresh again


[12/19/2025 8:09 AM] streikeizer
Not really tbh


[12/19/2025 9:35 AM] fvristar
the vulkan renderer?


[12/19/2025 9:37 AM] fvristar
do you mean in conjuction with dxvk or does fo4 support vulkan itself? wasn't aware if so


[12/19/2025 9:48 AM] renvy.kobold
how can i remove fallevil?


[12/19/2025 9:49 AM] gload
That download's long af
Stuck at 50% for like an hour


[12/19/2025 9:55 AM] kazifca
FO4 definitely does not support vulkan itself


[12/19/2025 9:56 AM] fvristar
afaik you just use enb's proxy library mechanism to load dxvk, no?


[12/19/2025 9:58 AM] kazifca
As far as I've read online, it hooks up with directX natively


[12/19/2025 10:01 AM] fvristar
dxvk just translates everything to vulkan
so it doesn't matter


[12/19/2025 10:02 AM] fvristar
just name the dxvk dll something like `dxvk.dll` and enable proxy library loading in the enb config, and specify the dll there


[12/19/2025 10:03 AM] jigsaw21101990
Do i understand this correctly. I download fallout 4 downgrader and downgrade to version 1.10.980. so when I am done with that and I set up steem to update game when I lunch game . So than I just install trough wabbajack and that is it. Did I understand it corectly


[12/19/2025 10:05 AM] fvristar
yep


[12/19/2025 10:05 AM] jigsaw21101990

anyone know if i turn hardcore off in mcm it wont brake game ?


[12/19/2025 10:05 AM] fvristar
it certainly won't be balanced as intended


[12/19/2025 10:06 AM] imfiredup26
as in for me ? or the world


[12/19/2025 10:08 AM] fvristar
um, both, i guess?


[12/19/2025 10:08 AM] fvristar
i'm probably mistaken but the hardcore mode is just restricted sleeping and needs right? so it's just removing that from it all. but there's cigarettes to let you save everywhere


[12/19/2025 10:08 AM] fvristar
and the needs is meant to be part of it


[12/19/2025 10:08 AM] fvristar
it's your game tho lol


[12/19/2025 10:25 AM] jigsaw21101990
Can I put installation folder on SSD and downloads forder on external disc


[12/19/2025 10:26 AM] fvristar

[12/19/2025 1:49 PM] playz_wolfe
soo on wabbajack it says i am missing files, i click try again but it keeps happening again? some files are missing idk whats going on


[12/19/2025 1:53 PM] puraaj
you have to manually downgrade your fallout install, let me find the link


[12/19/2025 1:54 PM] puraaj
actually, im not sure if i can just post a link xD @Plays-Wolf go to the support-forum scroll down till you see " how do i downgrade to version 1.10.980.0?? "


[12/19/2025 1:54 PM] puraaj
theres a link in there to how to do it manually via the steam console


[12/19/2025 2:38 PM] playz_wolfe

[12/20/2025 9:35 AM] panzerkadaver
Wabbacjack was not yet updated to downgrade the game from the last patch

And make sure to see the "download complete" line before launching the next depot download. There is no progress bar in the steam console and depending on your connection, it can take several minutes to complete the download


[12/20/2025 10:04 AM] positivecharliesheen
Hey, so im shooting and and falling back and the game keeps like going in slow motion (not using vats) for some reason at all


[12/20/2025 10:04 AM] bogwandi5395
Do all the presets not allow you to quicksave whenever you want? Or is it because I chose survival preset

I Installed Fallout 4 in English and now tried to install anomaly but i keep getting this messages, "This is a game file that could not be found. Validate the game is installed properly in the same language as that of the modlist author." for all game files

[12/20/2025 3:24 PM] wonderbread6689
its because you are in survival difficulty


[12/20/2025 3:24 PM] xmrmaj3sticx
Thanks for replying. I followed these steps and its saying its only missing the fallout.exe file


[12/20/2025 3:25 PM] wonderbread6689
i change it to very hard since for me the whole cigarrate thing is annoying

[12/20/2025 4:19 PM] puraaj
its best to cheat cigarettes (or turn off the whole save nonsense)
Trying to play fallout with 900 mods and no way of properly saving every 2-5 minutes is asking to lose most of your progress to random ass stuff


[12/20/2025 4:19 PM] panzerkadaver
Any known fix ?


[12/20/2025 4:20 PM] puraaj
fallout 4 vanilla is already notoriously buggy, add 900 mods on top of that .... you can see where this leads xD


[12/20/2025 4:35 PM] fallenstar39
Does anyone else still get the enb error message after adding the file? Is there anything else you need to do?


[12/20/2025 4:36 PM] georgebodge
you can turn the black screen off in the mcm menu as it happened to me

I downgrade fallout to version 1.10.984 than started wabbajack
What do I need to do to fix this


[12/21/2025 12:23 AM] fvristar
see the link directly above.


[12/21/2025 12:23 AM] fvristar
the installscript.vdf is a missing game file, not sure why you don't have that


[12/21/2025 12:24 AM] fvristar
can only think a pirated or gog copy (i don't know if the file exists for gog)


[12/21/2025 12:43 AM] kazifca
Press enter on your keyboard if that happens, it’s usually just the menu not menuing properly. It shouldn’t be a crash unless you’re literally crashing when you do it

Most likely not. Someone may take over and set it up to downgrade automatically but I doubt anyone wants the additional work of patching some ~~crappy~~ creations in too


[12/21/2025 4:59 AM] jigsaw21101990

Turn off the overlay in the MCM for Gas masks of the wasteland

Close enough. I had to disable the Overlay from the Damn Wasteland

While you are there do you mind checking something for me so I do not have to dip in and out of modlists (working on the upcoming one.


[12/21/2025 11:32 AM] panzerkadaver
Sure


[12/21/2025 11:32 AM] tiburse
Yea, some of that is dependant on what GPU you use. My nvidia laptop has no issues with it but AMD desktop does.


[12/21/2025 11:33 AM] tiburse
under ECO, Main is ballistic weave turned on or off in the anomaly config


[12/21/2025 11:33 AM] tiburse

[12/21/2025 11:34 AM] panzerkadaver
In MCM you mean ?

Yes

Why do we have to downgrade the game manually when Wabbajack supports downgrading the game automatically?


[12/22/2025 9:18 PM] wanderingsoul2911
hey! sooo quick question, if i get that new bounty hunter creationm pack can i use it on fallout anomaly?


[12/22/2025 9:18 PM] enyosverd
wym?


[12/22/2025 9:25 PM] vinidia
Wabbajack has functionality for downgrading Fallout 4 automatically. Check out the Magnum Opus install as an example.


[12/22/2025 9:27 PM] enyosverd
wait so how do you make it downgrade fallout?


[12/22/2025 9:27 PM] vinidia
it just does it as part of wabbajack's install process


[12/22/2025 9:39 PM] theyodelingyeet
does anyone know what the keybind for crafting things in bulk, it looks like its the " [ " key but that doesnt work


[12/22/2025 11:18 PM] fvristar
Because the modlist authors have stepped away and there has been no recompile to facilitate that

For "MachinegunsRebirth" i don't have the holotape, can't craft it, and attempting to uninstall the mod crashes the game on startup. any assistance on getting it to work? i want it to be in the level lists.

Go the abandoned tunnels. In the crafting bench you can find the recipe crafting journals.

How do you craft bullets?


[12/23/2025 2:45 PM] synn0634
Also saving to main menu isn’t working for me anyone else enhance that issue?


[12/23/2025 3:08 PM] jrkcsnake
Utility workbench to craft ammo workbench , you will have to unlock the recipe for each ammo type in the utility workbench , you unlock the recipe by using 100 bullets of that ammo type , expensive at first but well worth it entering the mid game


[12/23/2025 3:12 PM] jrkcsnake
I will also add getting acid is the hardest part of crafting ammo ,  still trying to find a way to reliably farm it


[12/23/2025 3:15 PM] synn0634
Sweet thank you, any idea why exit and save wouldn’t be working?


[12/23/2025 3:19 PM] jrkcsnake
I believe my exit to desktop does create an exit save , although I’ve had back luck with exit saves I always use a cigarette or sleep before getting off as insurance.


[12/23/2025 3:21 PM] synn0634
Okay thank you I appreciate the responses


[12/23/2025 3:23 PM] synn0634
Also when I created a new character all my weapons were only doing like 3 damage but when I reloaded it seemed to fix it back to regular


[12/23/2025 3:23 PM] synn0634
I’m new to the pack so I’m just encountering things and wondering if they’re normal lol


[12/23/2025 5:06 PM] jackmcneal
How do you get rid of the little 24/hour clock in the top right? Or is there even a way, can't find a solution in the mod config

[12/23/2025 9:02 PM] synn0634
any time i try to load my game at a save i made using a bed i get a weird endless loading screen but i can kind of still open my pip boy anyone know a fix?


[12/23/2025 9:04 PM] fvristar
this is only with that one save, or all saves at any bed?


[12/23/2025 9:07 PM] synn0634
im abt to try to replicate it once im able to get back to my bed


[12/23/2025 9:07 PM] synn0634
hold on one sec


[12/23/2025 9:07 PM] synn0634
had to load back pretty far


[12/23/2025 9:09 PM] synn0634
a save i used at a random bed worked but this is the second character that this has happened to one save was in sanctuary and the other was in a minutemen camp


[12/23/2025 9:14 PM] fvristar
just sounds like something is unfortunately breaking with scripting or instancing


[12/23/2025 9:14 PM] fvristar
all 'newer' bethesda games do this modded or otherwise


[12/23/2025 9:14 PM] fvristar
unfortunately ^^'


[12/23/2025 9:15 PM] synn0634
should reinstall? maybe an error occurred while installing? or maybe its just a coincidence that its happened so frequently?


[12/23/2025 9:16 PM] fvristar
once per run on two different characters is not what i would call frequent


[12/23/2025 9:16 PM] fvristar
but you can rerun wabbajack pointed at the same directory and it'll pick up if anything is different from how it should be


[12/23/2025 9:16 PM] synn0634
okay yeah ig so it just feels frequent because one was yesterday and one was today


[12/23/2025 9:17 PM] fvristar
it could just be your way of playing. my bf was having save issues but it turns out he's just too quick in the settlement menus and it frequently breaks things going fast


[12/23/2025 9:17 PM] fvristar
and that's basically just because the game is so modded


[12/23/2025 9:17 PM] synn0634
ah i see


[12/23/2025 9:17 PM] synn0634
thanks for your help


[12/23/2025 9:18 PM] fvristar
i tend to just slow down when i'm going in and out of menus, even the pipboy


[12/23/2025 9:18 PM] synn0634
ill run wabba again just for fun and see if that helps anything

I got my pack installed yesterday, it is possible


[12/23/2025 11:02 PM] spiegel_
Idk it keeps saying download failed and it cant find the actual game files but i think its related to a recent game update and the downgrader

Is there a comprehensive medical guide to the modlist? I can't seem to find a proper way to deal with internal bleeding.


[12/24/2025 10:19 PM] soarin_skys
Unsure why true damage is even in modpacks. Its scripts break often resulting in weapons that shoot nerf darts to pistols that can 1 shot liberty prime.

[12/25/2025 2:55 PM] eldritchwat
the controls section of the settings doesnt even have vats/vafs on there


[12/25/2025 3:50 PM] ned4903
I've been testing that too, G gives you bullet time until your ap drains

I Believe its Z that activates your crit attack


[12/25/2025 4:08 PM] eldritchwat

So I finally made it through concord, went to get the power armor, and found that it was locked behind the training mechanic, and therefore so was the mini gun. Is concord just suppose to be a higher level are that you skip until you’re better armed, or is there some other way you are supposed to be able to kill a deathclaw with what’s on hand?


[12/25/2025 5:53 PM] adrelala

guys ive tried this for a week now and it isnt working out for me my game file source is still missing can someone help me? the reddit depot and the depot posted here doesnt work at all. putting the files in backwards doesnt work, restarting the computer doesnt work, uninstalling and reinstalling and deleting the documents folder of fallout doesnt work, I dont know why the game file sources arent working. Ive deleted and redownloaded wabbajack incase it was that. I genuinely have no clue what I have done wrong, I love reading I know how to follow instructions I hate leaving something unfinished 

Data_Fallout4 - Startup.ba2    Game file source
2    Data_Fallout4 - Textures3.ba2    Game file source

dang...and i got it at the beginning of the game too....long ways from a doctor or building a decon arch


[12/26/2025 7:54 PM] kazifca
Sorry, totally did not clue into the fact I should tell you how to cure it, not paying attention. 
Depending on how rough the start was I might just restart myself if it happened off the bat, if you're a little ways into settlement building you need influence 2, which you get fairly early in skill investment and medicine 1, which I think is 25 into medicine, then you can assign one. 
They aren't that high of requirements and only takes a couple of levels to get, it's more so the bottle caps that might be a difficulty depending on how early you are into the game 
I'm not sure if refreshing beverage actually cures it, but you can type help "refreshing beverage" 4 to cheat one in

any1 know what to do when u exit the vault and are stuck in a blacked out screen? watching a stream and its happened twice now


[12/27/2025 12:08 PM] theyodelingyeet
Gotta say from all these fancy fast travel mods or Vehicle transports, the tunnel system is the smoothest most enjoyable form of getting around the map. I even set up base down there so i always have a centralized home

Can i reduce the amount of loot (ammo, heals etc) without starting a new game? Loot Module able to work onlt with new game, but i don't want to restart progress

how do i get curie to revive nora, doesnt seem to be an option


[12/27/2025 1:25 PM] kazifca
There’s like 2-4 cartons in sanctuary, exploring the surrounding area has always netted me in the realm of 7-10 before even bothering to head that direction, usually before even going into concord. 
If you’ve picked up scrapper, tag asbestos for search and then cigarettes will get highlighted when you’re close by

thanks homie its working now.


[12/27/2025 3:58 PM] adrelala
gonna have to restart with toned down option settings for some of the survival stuff cause wow...the rad aspect is way more unforgiving than even Stalker

Would melee be viable early game?


[12/27/2025 7:56 PM] terroristpotato
Always wanted to do a melee build


[12/28/2025 2:58 AM] kazifca
I wouldn't put it down as a great idea, but if you max stealth and get night vision early on, its doable, albeit with misery


[12/28/2025 3:17 AM] schmegegge
hey real quick I'm using a downgrader for fallout 4... what version of the game should I downgrade to?


[12/28/2025 3:17 AM] schmegegge
i figured it would be v1.10.163 but idk


[12/28/2025 3:24 AM] kazifca



[12/28/2025 3:42 AM] schmegegge
yeah was trying that but steam kept having download failures and I got frustrated with having to watch over it lol


[12/28/2025 3:43 AM] schmegegge
thx tho


[12/28/2025 3:44 AM] kazifca
Download failures is odd for steam


[12/28/2025 3:45 AM] ehsmkingwolf
when they going to update this


[12/28/2025 4:49 AM] kazifca
I continued pondering this concept, if you're wanting, you could try adding in a couple of the simple dodges mods, I just slapped them ontop of everything and it ran, wouldn't recommend that but it would make melee more viable in an amusingly dark souls like fashion


[12/28/2025 4:50 AM] ludens_001
I learned the hard way not to tempt the mod gods in such a way. Finally built a solid stalker and when I loaded my save, black flickering and errors everywhere.


[12/28/2025 4:52 AM] ludens_001
I got quite a few hours of enjoyment though, and it was 110% my own fault. No idea what specifically caused it, but I haphazardly tossed in two armor mods and a tac tablet.


[12/28/2025 4:54 AM] kazifca
I added point lookout, bout a dozen weapon mods, three armor sets, and just now the simple dodges mods, which I'm trying to figure out a better load order for than last lmao. 
It's been fairly stable since throwing in the vulkan proxy library and not using an enb, I just now ran into crashes which has made me look at my load order


[12/28/2025 4:55 AM] ludens_001
You don't get the whole flickering black angles of doom?


[12/28/2025 4:55 AM] kazifca
I'm on an RX5700xt, and no


[12/28/2025 4:56 AM] kazifca
Currently looking at gettng more frames for less input though that may be a high ask


[12/28/2025 4:56 AM] ludens_001
Now I'm even more confused as to what I broke.


[12/28/2025 4:57 AM] ludens_001
Like it runs super smoothly, I just get that weird flickering and screen blackening / lighting stuff. Otherwise, constant 60 cap.


[12/28/2025 4:57 AM] kazifca
GPU?


[12/28/2025 4:57 AM] ludens_001
AMD, gimme a sec for specifics (yes, have the AMD optionals enabled)


[12/28/2025 4:59 AM] ludens_001
AMD Radeon RX 6750 XT


[12/28/2025 5:00 AM] kazifca
Rasturize it


[12/28/2025 5:01 AM] kazifca
Did you try a DXVK proxy library? It might make a difference, AMD cards are just sometimes, odd


[12/28/2025 5:02 AM] kazifca
If that doesn't change performance you may have to put it out as a sacrifice to zeus or something, see if he can cook sumn up


[12/28/2025 5:02 AM] kazifca
Basically what I did


[12/28/2025 5:04 AM] ludens_001
Rasturize, didn't know about that before. I think I can give that a try.


[12/28/2025 5:05 AM] kazifca
Not tryina drag dawg into this, can't forward but this guy informed me


[12/28/2025 5:07 AM] ludens_001
whole time I thought it was precombines broken


[12/28/2025 5:08 AM] kazifca
It could be tbh


[12/28/2025 5:08 AM] kazifca
I’m not claiming to fix it


[12/28/2025 5:08 AM] fvristar
Not a guy but what's the problem lol

I can play for a hot second, have some fun, but something I did (I added in two armor mods, 'shuttheprotagonistup.esl', and a tac pad) and when I hop back in, I get the most insane graphical errors and I have _no_ clue what caused it.

Initially I chalked it up to "well that sucks" but now that there may be a fix on the table


[12/28/2025 5:10 AM] ludens_001
I'm giving it a go. I got to a really juicy spot where I had a suppressed long gun and good stealth skills, and just Solid Snake'd through corvega.


[12/28/2025 5:10 AM] kazifca
Where did those land in your load order


[12/28/2025 5:11 AM] ludens_001
Probably slapped them in near the end, I didn't give it too much thought. When I used to mod FO4, I didn't have such a good PC, so I relied on Vortex and prior to that the good ol' XboxOne bethesda mods.


[12/28/2025 5:12 AM] ludens_001
I did adjust them to be before prp.exe


[12/28/2025 5:12 AM] fvristar
What's this tac pad? I'm not familiar lol


[12/28/2025 5:12 AM] ludens_001
So this is all a sort of trial by fire to me.


[12/28/2025 5:12 AM] fvristar
Is it just an equippable thing?


[12/28/2025 5:12 AM] ludens_001
Tactical Tablet, there's an addition on Nexus which gives it the model from MW2019. I like it, it's got a stylus. It adds to the character lore™


[12/28/2025 5:13 AM] ludens_001
Pip-Boy replacer, tablet version


[12/28/2025 5:13 AM] ludens_001
I saw someone using it in a playthrough with no issues, however.


[12/28/2025 5:13 AM] fvristar
Ah okay yeah none of that should necessarily need to be above prp but it being there shouldn't hurt anything


[12/28/2025 5:13 AM] fvristar
The black flickering stuff sounds completely disconnected from what you've described adding


[12/28/2025 5:14 AM] fvristar
Almost like a driver issue or hardware


[12/28/2025 5:14 AM] fvristar
You're not overclocked or undervolted or anything?


[12/28/2025 5:15 AM] ludens_001
Shouldn't be, I'll check it out. Never had this happen before, so it's a bit of a first in general.


[12/28/2025 5:16 AM] kazifca
immediately why I went to DXVK lmao


[12/28/2025 5:16 AM] kazifca
Though bethesda


[12/28/2025 5:18 AM] ludens_001
Like if I'm in third person and I stand really still, completely fine

First person - the world begins tearing itself apart.


[12/28/2025 5:19 AM] kazifca
I used to run into driver issues, my computer just straight up crashes and restarts though.


[12/28/2025 5:19 AM] ludens_001
And it's only ever a problem when I come back to a save. When I start from a new game, it's bueno all around.


[12/28/2025 5:21 AM] kazifca
If you haven't give it to a go, it solved my driver issues, albeit my symptoms were different.


[12/28/2025 5:21 AM] kazifca
Can't promise it will work but it is incredibly simple to do and will take you about 2 minutes


[12/28/2025 5:23 AM] fvristar
Ah that distinction does actually make me think about the tac pad mod


[12/28/2025 5:26 AM] ludens_001
Upon seeing this, I decided to look at the mod page for it, sure enough someone is there talking about the world flickering.


[12/28/2025 5:26 AM] kazifca

[12/28/2025 5:26 AM] ludens_001
it _might_ fix it


[12/28/2025 5:27 AM] ludens_001
It seemed a lot more 'serious' than just the tablet, if that makes sense.


[12/28/2025 5:28 AM] fvristar
Broken meshes can cause some insane visuals

I had it chalked up to "Welp, I broke it, guess it's time to leave fallout 4 again"


[12/28/2025 5:32 AM] ludens_001
True. Well, if it weren't for you tagging furi, would never have been given the nudge towards the tablet.

[12/28/2025 5:35 AM] ludens_001
Don't fall for the attractive aesthetic of a tablet with a stylus and working ports modeled onto it. The textures apparently bork your entire existence in-game.

[12/28/2025 5:40 AM] ludens_001
now I can recklessly add in a bunch of weapon mods and break it for real!


[12/28/2025 5:40 AM] fvristar
Weapons are pretty safe but they won't be balanced which can be annoying


[12/28/2025 5:43 AM] kazifca
Me and all my friends are planning on playing the TTRPG, I was thinking of drawing up a weapons list (because the TTRPG is lacking like holay) and maybe implementing it into the game over combined arms. Where would you recommend locking in on collecting skills for this task


[12/28/2025 5:44 AM] fvristar
i'm pretty confused on what you're asking tbh


[12/28/2025 5:45 AM] fvristar
few wines deep xd


[12/28/2025 5:46 AM] kazifca
Mostly weapon tweaks, level list integration, not modeling as a fair few of the list already exist as mods, or creating entirely new stuff


[12/28/2025 5:46 AM] fvristar
oh ig the TTRPG part confused me


[12/28/2025 5:47 AM] fvristar
uhh you can do a lot of that in xedit alone and pretty straightforwardly too


[12/28/2025 5:48 AM] fvristar
for creating though you just use the creation kit


[12/28/2025 5:48 AM] fvristar
as convoluted as it can be it's still probably the most documented way


[12/28/2025 5:48 AM] kazifca
I'll probably work with what's available first, a pretty large portion of guns are available, though not everything


[12/28/2025 5:49 AM] kazifca
Finding a Bren 10 seems like a challange


[12/28/2025 5:50 AM] kazifca
might go out of my way to learn to do stuff like that, the ithaca 37 mods are cool, but would be better suited as a host of uniques


[12/28/2025 5:50 AM] ludens_001
Lightsabers were never meant to be balanced in the first place.


[12/28/2025 5:50 AM] ludens_001
(I'm kidding. Don't hurt me.)


[12/28/2025 5:50 AM] kazifca
Lightsabers if ever possible would not be balanced


[12/28/2025 5:54 AM] ludens_001
There was a mod that added them once upon a time. I really liked that they went the extra mile to include proper scorch marks according to the cuts you made, _and_ they glowed.

like did you stay near a doctor or a town with one


[12/28/2025 9:30 PM] theta_centauri
Just curious.  I pretty much abandoned Fallout 4 at the announcement this mod will be discontinued....but i see all this talk about downgrading and stuff.  Will the mod be continued in a downgraded state or is it simply for quality of life in its current state?  Anomaly was the only reason I played F4.


[12/28/2025 9:45 PM] fvristar
There is no current or planned official work on this list


[12/28/2025 9:45 PM] fvristar
Its just as is for now


[12/28/2025 9:55 PM] soarin_skys

[12/28/2025 9:56 PM] centrys_the_son
It works mostly alright Just gotta keep your rads low thankfully you can get heather who has a lot of anti rad and rad resist stuff for cheap if you want but Im def not using this modlist again after this playthrough


[12/28/2025 9:57 PM] soarin_skys
Some vehicles are a jumbled mess like prp just died and the model thats supposed to replace a tank or apc is like not working and it defaults to the vanilla mesh but since the mesh is being replaced its invisable lmao


[12/28/2025 9:57 PM] centrys_the_son
There is cleansing tonic I think it gets rid of stuff like cesium cold but it does nothing for the random Periodic Rads you get when you get high rads you need a doctor for that


[12/28/2025 9:59 PM] soarin_skys
I mean precombine


[12/28/2025 9:59 PM] soarin_skys

[12/29/2025 2:30 AM] va1haze
Yes. My first thought was that maybe its meant to be like that, because i tested it multiple times. Wehn starting with male character, the vault had those items, then tested multiple times with female character and always the items were missing. i have no idea what could possibly cause it. How a gender can affect what items gets spawned in the world?


[12/29/2025 2:34 AM] fvristar
It absolutely shouldnt

Hey, so I want to install Anomaly, but I'm on 1.10.163...
I want absolutely nothing to do with Bethesda's latest ~~acts of sabotage~~ I mean, "updates".

Will I be able to get by running Anomaly on 1.10.163 or should I just forget it?

Or entering an interior for 10 seconds to grab an item and exit boom instantly those clear skies turn into a rad storm out of nowhere.

anyone have a recomendation on a mod thats compatible with the modlist and allows a settlement in this area? Trying to create a freeside type of town outside Diamond City but Conquest is a no go and Commonwealth GECK Project seems incompatible with the modlist as i can't send settlers there and it doesn't show up in the settlement list??

Download 501 version two times so you have one file and (1) file and put them both in downloads


[12/30/2025 5:35 PM] jigsaw21101990
And restart wabbajack and try again

[12/31/2025 1:11 AM] kazifca
I mean I just add them Willy Nilly ngl, just throw them before the anomaly level list patch and it’s been smooth so far


[12/31/2025 1:11 AM] ragnor_ragnorson
So go into mods and just toss them in?


[12/31/2025 1:11 AM] kazifca
You can also, turn them off if they fuck it up 😉


[12/31/2025 1:11 AM] kazifca
Nah use MO2


[12/31/2025 1:11 AM] ragnor_ragnorson
Lol idk where to began there


[12/31/2025 1:12 AM] kazifca

Use the tunnels and APC


[12/31/2025 3:55 AM] soarin_skys
Turn the tunnels into your hub


[12/31/2025 3:56 AM] soarin_skys
Make trade routes to other settlements


[12/31/2025 3:56 AM] soarin_skys
Its funny. You can take off the chain from the gate by moving your cursor in the middle of it.


[12/31/2025 3:56 AM] soarin_skys

[12/31/2025 6:08 AM] stinagrey
does anybody knows why my gasmask hud icon on top left corner randomly dissapears even when i have gas mask equipped? no i did not pressed anything hud related that could turn off hud icons


[12/31/2025 8:10 AM] stinagrey
i think gasmask hud is connected to compass and compas dissapears when u dont have gun up that seems to mess up wwith gasmask widget any way to force compass always on?


[12/31/2025 8:24 AM] stinagrey
so how do i force gasmask hud always on?


[12/31/2025 8:39 AM] stinagrey
better how do i force to all hud stuff always on hp ap compass???


[12/31/2025 9:02 AM] jigsaw21101990
How can I use women character lol


[12/31/2025 9:08 AM] jigsaw21101990
Never mind I figured it out it confused me because it asked for name first


[12/31/2025 9:10 AM] lexouav
Hi everyone, is it normal that at the end of the game (I've completed all the quests) I can't make any wishes? When I choose between the six, my game crashes instantly. 
Thanks.


[12/31/2025 9:19 AM] stinagrey
my gasmask hud is dissapearing because of compas widged dissapearing after i holster weapon is there any way to force all hud widgets to stay ON??


[12/31/2025 10:16 AM] pabloatpreschoolyt
Is it normal to turn invisible when crouching?


[12/31/2025 10:26 AM] ratkingcrispy
hey random question but sometimes even with the gas mask on the waether changes and I am just blasted with rads, anyone know why and how I can avoid it


[12/31/2025 10:30 AM] ratkingcrispy
nevermind I figured out I need to change my gasmask mine was the stalker gasmask and did not work like others


[12/31/2025 10:40 AM] stinagrey
some legendary gear effect most likely


[12/31/2025 10:40 AM] stinagrey
is not your gasmask HUD dissapearing?


[12/31/2025 10:40 AM] ratkingcrispy
It was until I found a gasmask with goggles


[12/31/2025 10:41 AM] stinagrey
i am asking because mine gasmask HUD is dissapearing when my compass hud widget dissapears and i need to reload save to gasmask to popup


[12/31/2025 10:42 AM] ratkingcrispy
use fallui to turn off the compass is what I did


[12/31/2025 10:42 AM] ratkingcrispy
or just make the compass super tiny and hide it away if that doesn't work


[12/31/2025 10:42 AM] stinagrey
but i want my compass i just need somehow to lock all hud widgets not to hide


[12/31/2025 10:43 AM] ratkingcrispy
oooh, then maybe turn off Immersive hud or Ihud


[12/31/2025 10:44 AM] ratkingcrispy
that should keep everything turned on 24/7 I personally do away with as much as I can but that might be your best bet


[12/31/2025 10:45 AM] stinagrey
i dont want to mess with modlist that much and i want to play as vanilla anomaly as possible turning of those mods will for sure mess with hud widgets i just somehow need to lock them i wonder why there is no such options in MCM menu


[12/31/2025 10:46 AM] ratkingcrispy
oh no you don't have to turn those mods off in Mod Organizer I turned them off in the mcm menu in game


[12/31/2025 10:46 AM] stinagrey
so you are using vanilla f4 hud?


[12/31/2025 10:46 AM] ratkingcrispy
In the in game mcm menu for me they are under (User Interface) and then Ihud is under Hud++


[12/31/2025 10:47 AM] ratkingcrispy
No I am using the default for the modpack I just tweaked them with fall ui to my liking a bit more


[12/31/2025 10:47 AM] ratkingcrispy
if you are in the game right now I got like 10 minuets we could discord call and screen share I could try and help you


[12/31/2025 10:48 AM] stinagrey
well sure


[12/31/2025 10:48 AM] stinagrey
let me turn on the game


[12/31/2025 10:48 AM] pabloatpreschoolyt
just started up a run, might be a skill  from background idk


[12/31/2025 10:48 AM] stinagrey
something you wear?


[12/31/2025 10:49 AM] stinagrey
maybe check perks


[12/31/2025 11:12 AM] knowing_goyim
Anyone know if curie stops healing companions if u complete her questline?


[12/31/2025 11:29 AM] bladakin
theres a compass? im not far into the game still getting my ass whooped


[12/31/2025 12:35 PM] lzykaiser
am i the only one or do yall also get oneshotted in concord


[12/31/2025 1:14 PM] lzykaiser

[12/31/2025 1:28 PM] kazifca
Sneak


[12/31/2025 1:29 PM] lzykaiser
okay it worked for me to get in but i cant use power armor it says i need someone to teach me


[12/31/2025 1:31 PM] kazifca
Yep, gotta get trained


[12/31/2025 1:31 PM] lzykaiser
how


[12/31/2025 1:31 PM] kazifca
Atom cats, the castle or BOS


[12/31/2025 1:31 PM] lzykaiser
so no early power armor for quest?


[12/31/2025 1:31 PM] kazifca
Not that I know of


[12/31/2025 1:32 PM] kazifca
I always bring a rifle


[12/31/2025 1:32 PM] lzykaiser
well i didnt get lucky with loot+


[12/31/2025 2:13 PM] kazifca
In the bag outside of sanctuary right beside the statue there should be some kind of rifle


[12/31/2025 2:13 PM] kazifca
Or a weapon you can turn into one


[12/31/2025 2:14 PM] kazifca
You can go to the electronics disposal sight, send the sentry bot to USAF Olivia, and loot the raiders then do the dungeon


[12/31/2025 2:14 PM] kazifca
Or you can bait the enemies in and wait for Preston to ping them


[12/31/2025 2:16 PM] kazifca
Or, hit the vault 111 military facility, and loot the raiders in there


[12/31/2025 2:17 PM] kazifca
If you’re feeling dangerous there’s a shotgun pistol in the ranger cabin


[12/31/2025 2:23 PM] kazifca
Also idk if anyone knows this, the makeshift shotgun is absolutely ridiculous in terms of accuracy and damage for early game, middle game, and it’s more accurate than some late game shotgun choices even with extra weapons added to the list


[12/31/2025 3:13 PM] bubostabbins
So.. my character has got 4 diseases at this point. I spent hours last night first getting to bunker hill, then getting to diamond city just to discover that neither settlement's doctors will cure diseases, nor had antibiotics for sale. 

Anyone have any ideas on getting rid of em? I'm increasingly low in meds, and the infections keep spreading causing more dmg and I haven't been able to sprint for ~6 in game hours. 😭


[12/31/2025 4:00 PM] bubostabbins
I have found and purchased 2 antibiotics now, I have taken them both at seperate occasions and slept all night and not only did none of my 5 diseases go away, I gained a 6th..... wtf?

yeh, im like 6 antibiotics down, 3 days of sleep. No autoimmune depressants..... i don't get it. My whole playthrough seems to be dead to uncurable diseases.


[12/31/2025 5:32 PM] knowing_goyim
You gotta see a doctor and remove rads. Theyre ingested rads diseases and keep ticking unless you take care of the radiation

Happy New Year everyone~


[1/1/2026 1:53 AM] soarin_skys
Does it consume a stimpak


[1/1/2026 1:53 AM] soarin_skys

hey so im newish to this, but once the game has settled and mods have been updated, do i just redownload through wabbajack to update the list? or will that literally re-download all the mods again?

[1/1/2026 5:38 PM] ellieeson
is there a way to play the modlist in a easier difficulty? I've somehow got radiation infection, titanium lung or something, couldn't run, needed antibiotics


[1/1/2026 5:38 PM] ellieeson
and i've been using the mask


[1/1/2026 5:38 PM] ellieeson

[1/1/2026 5:54 PM] acuteapple
does smooth motion not work?


[1/1/2026 6:23 PM] soarin_skys
Try to make a silencer and max sneak. Mask might need a filter replacement or its broken


[1/1/2026 7:18 PM] rockitao
is there any perk that makes my character jump higher? at the start I picked one of the skill that makes jump height of only 50%, while having more sneak skill... is there any way to compensate this?


[1/1/2026 7:22 PM] meatshower
Anyone have an idea why most of my settlers are like this? Are they hurt?

[1/1/2026 11:53 PM] kazifca
Go into aid, click any of the gas mask filters, if you go into MCM, find the maim wheel somewhere in maim and set a hotkey.
I use G. 
There's extra roaches in the vault, so be thorough in your murder hoboing


[1/1/2026 11:53 PM] soarin_skys
There's a radroach hiding

is it normal to meele weapons to have like 3 dmg when for example starting pistol has around 30


[1/2/2026 4:51 AM] kazifca
You got any skill points in weaponry?


[1/2/2026 4:53 AM] stinagrey
17


[1/2/2026 4:54 AM] kazifca
I’m pretty sure weapons, in general do less damage the less skill points you’ve put in their specific category


[1/2/2026 4:54 AM] kazifca
That disparity is pretty high though


[1/2/2026 4:54 AM] kazifca
Which melee weapon is it


[1/2/2026 4:54 AM] stinagrey
amkes sense but i have not mich in longarms for example 15 and my long guns do like 90 dmg makes no sense ti me


[1/2/2026 4:55 AM] kazifca
Bullets


[1/2/2026 4:55 AM] stinagrey
bowie knife


[1/2/2026 4:55 AM] stinagrey
has 6+3 bcs it has mod


[1/2/2026 4:55 AM] kazifca
That sounds right


[1/2/2026 4:56 AM] kazifca
The games balanced around calibres as far as I know in terms of damage


[1/2/2026 4:56 AM] stinagrey
rly? and pistol with 30 dmg sounds right too? when starting baton has 3 dmg


[1/2/2026 4:56 AM] stinagrey
like i know i have 3 strength right nou but still


[1/2/2026 4:56 AM] kazifca
10mm is a pretty hefty gun

help “refreshing beverage” 4, if it don’t work speed level up like 4-5 times in your settlement and put down a doctor ASAP


[1/2/2026 11:29 AM] darkwater4189
Ill look up the beverage, thanks. 
Speed lvl by building things you mean?

Putting a doctor down in my settlement? Im lvl 1 in my underwear. 🤣


[1/2/2026 11:35 AM] darkwater4189
Also dogmeat went down after one hit of a bug. Now he wants a stimpack and he wont move anymore. 

I barely use those on myself unless i really need it, but now my dog needs it after he gets hit once. 

Also interesting, came out of the elevator from the vault, instant permanent rads. And im dead. Couldnt go anywhere without a gasmask. Are you suppose to play fulltime with a mask on? That’s not gonna happen from my end. 

Time to watch a YouTube on how this all works or makes sense.


[1/2/2026 11:44 AM] kazifca
Take a look at mod config


[1/2/2026 11:50 AM] darkwater4189
I applied the default settings if that’s what you mean? I did it when I found the pipboy.

[1/2/2026 6:11 PM] soarin_skys
Shift K


[1/2/2026 6:11 PM] soarin_skys
It wipes your mask


[1/2/2026 6:12 PM] soarin_skys
Its when you apply the setting


[1/2/2026 6:12 PM] soarin_skys
When you first start the game


[1/2/2026 6:12 PM] soarin_skys
After you applied as per anomaly tutorial


[1/2/2026 6:12 PM] soarin_skys
You can change it in Immersive hud. I think theres a setting that makes your compass appear when you have your weapon out


[1/2/2026 6:13 PM] ey12345
you are correct, thank you very much. I think i had pressed F2 which toggles immesive hud on/off


[1/2/2026 6:21 PM] calicojack_2205
No no, it's not dirt on the mask, it's like it has a saturation filter on it


[1/2/2026 6:21 PM] soarin_skys
Oh i know what you mean


[1/2/2026 6:21 PM] soarin_skys
I dont like it either but im afraid of breaking something so I dont change the settings lol

I would just live with it


[1/2/2026 7:39 PM] soarin_skys
Its just


[1/2/2026 7:40 PM] soarin_skys
Minor but by a fallout immersion standpoint I understand


[1/2/2026 7:41 PM] sirtronomodo
The problem is that everyone refers to it as caps, and it doesn't make sense that there is a special time of ammunition that is just currency

When you play on the anomaly default setting, are you supposed to need a gas-mask any time you are outside? Because I currently do not and I just want to make sure I’m not seeing a bug.


[1/2/2026 8:03 PM] soarin_skys
During weather


[1/2/2026 8:03 PM] soarin_skys
When it rains you'll get like a lot of rads


[1/2/2026 8:03 PM] soarin_skys
anywhere that has radiation


[1/2/2026 8:03 PM] soarin_skys
You get radiation with no gas mask you get IRA


[1/2/2026 8:04 PM] soarin_skys
and once you get 1000 IRA you die


[1/2/2026 8:04 PM] soarin_skys
its seperate from radiation


[1/2/2026 8:04 PM] soarin_skys
and you cant really lower it down without certain items or doctor

[1/3/2026 7:52 AM] acuteapple
so i finally got smooth motion too work in exchange for longer load times i say its worth


[1/3/2026 7:55 AM] forplay3172
hey guys, great mod, runs very smooth. I would suggest to do smth with sneak perks and sneak damage. First 15-20 levels are great experience, after that I become too powerful, shooting a silenced gun while sneaking for x15 dmg, two-shotting Swan etc. Also sneaking is too easy, can sneak up close. Feral ghouls in this modlist are scary, but their movements are awkward and slow comparing to original ghouls, they even sprint and jump like in slow-motion (also lickers break immersion but its just my opinion)


[1/3/2026 7:57 AM] acuteapple
try sneak melee


[1/3/2026 8:20 AM] pobe24
Thats in the mod manager?

gimme a sec to rerun it


[1/3/2026 9:41 AM] kurisuthecoyote_7337
I will have to see if it is because I had downgrade fallout 4 to the november patch or something, I am redownloading it atm

trying out wabajack lists is fun, but each one seems to need its own specific version of fallout 4


[1/3/2026 9:46 AM] kurisuthecoyote_7337
alright so far I havent seen any download errors past some modlist image ones


[1/3/2026 10:25 AM] swittens
So does the newest update work with the newest Fallout 4 update, or am I reading this wrong?


[1/3/2026 10:26 AM] streikeizer
Yeah


[1/3/2026 10:27 AM] streikeizer
if not i fucked up somewhere😅


[1/3/2026 10:28 AM] swittens
Sick! Just tried reinstalling yesterday and was having a horrid time trying to downgrade and all that


[1/3/2026 10:32 AM] hashtag_sam
New download worked a treat, I was updated to 1.11.191.0 and it installed (with the enb copy download) and runs fine. I've noticed the museum and one of the shops you can enter in Concord is just absurdly dark - to the point the flashlight wouldn't even help. Interiors need more lighting, it's no fun squinting at your screen for movement.


[1/3/2026 11:28 AM] swittens
Do I just put enb series into the Fallout 4 folder? Whenever I try to install the wabbajack list, it still reads it as not being there


[1/3/2026 12:01 PM] darkwater4189
You put it in the downloads folder in where you are instelling the modlist in. For example d:\anomaly\downloads.

Then retry/restart wabbajack.


[1/3/2026 12:02 PM] swittens
Okie Dokie, thanks


[1/3/2026 12:07 PM] peanuts1582
No matter what location I put the ENB into it is unable to find it, and starts downloading the one with the unexpected hash.


[1/3/2026 12:10 PM] peanuts1582
It also doesn't install any MO2.exe or any other folders except for mod zips, which I am guessing is because it can't progress after ENB fail..


[1/3/2026 12:13 PM] hype325
i have some mild confusion, is the next gen version of the game the one with all the creation club content?


[1/3/2026 12:14 PM] swittens
I think that's the newest version


[1/3/2026 12:14 PM] swittens
Are you decompiling the ENB folder? Just put the full folder into either downloads or the root and it should be fine


[1/3/2026 12:18 PM] peanuts1582
Yeah I was decompiling... Now it progresses further, many thanks. Hope nothing else shows up..


[1/3/2026 12:20 PM] swittens
Good luck, my installation is at 75/193 GB, if my download fails near the end I'm gonna be pretty peeved lmao


[1/3/2026 12:46 PM] sirtronomodo
doe anyone know how to not be one-shot without power armor?


[1/3/2026 12:46 PM] kazifca
Helmet


[1/3/2026 12:47 PM] kazifca
Also, a lot of stealth ranger


[1/3/2026 12:49 PM] sirtronomodo
do the enemies always hit you on the head?


[1/3/2026 12:52 PM] kazifca
No, I snag a pistol and go straight to AR2 vault 111 management facility (I think that's the name) where its dark and there's enough raiders to roll a chance at a decent weapon, and shoot roughly, at least, seven of them in the head


[1/3/2026 12:52 PM] kazifca
also stop to sneak kill some bloat flies, a bloodbug and a dog along the way


[1/3/2026 12:53 PM] sirtronomodo
You talking about the America Rising 2 location? I found it pretty difficult with a pistol, enemies tank like 7 shots and one-tap you. Concord seems easier to get good gear.


[1/3/2026 12:54 PM] kazifca
Aim for the head, it's also dark


[1/3/2026 12:54 PM] kazifca
First group is a group of 2


[1/3/2026 12:54 PM] kazifca
pace your shots, peak, lean, disengage and reengage


[1/3/2026 12:55 PM] kazifca
They don't have perfect accuracy I can say that


[1/3/2026 12:55 PM] kazifca
mag dump only if you have too, theres times in my first runs where I have reloaded for mag dumping


[1/3/2026 12:55 PM] kazifca
That was like, very early though


[1/3/2026 12:55 PM] kazifca
you'll get used to it


[1/3/2026 12:56 PM] sirtronomodo
Is endurance worth it? Does increasing your health even matter or is damage resist only important?


[1/3/2026 12:56 PM] kazifca
Early on, I would lean more into playing and engaging well as you want scrounger and scrapper ASAP


[1/3/2026 12:57 PM] kazifca
Later on when you have to fight enemies with missile launchers, who only need to hit in your general vicinity, things start to change


[1/3/2026 12:58 PM] kazifca
Play with guerilla tactics really


[1/3/2026 12:59 PM] sirtronomodo
Ok, thanks. Should I just speck full into int then, besides 2 end for lead belly? There are so many perks in this mod it's very difficult to figure out what to pick.


[1/3/2026 1:00 PM] kazifca
For your first run def throw 2 into end for led belly, once you're used to all the mechanics you won't really need it beyond convenience of crafting.


[1/3/2026 1:01 PM] kazifca
Int specing is alright, makes the game easy too fast though in a similar way to new vegas


[1/3/2026 1:01 PM] kazifca
first playthroughs when I was learning playing int is fine, but truly the best character is dump stating luck and running with it


[1/3/2026 1:02 PM] sirtronomodo
What does luck even do?


[1/3/2026 1:02 PM] kazifca
No clue, don't care


[1/3/2026 1:02 PM] kazifca
Wouldn't be fun if I did


[1/3/2026 1:03 PM] kazifca
Thats not true, YAE has some notes about luck


[1/3/2026 1:03 PM] kazifca
I'm sure it's been touched up upon in the modpack tho


[1/3/2026 1:38 PM] kazifca
A question for anyone enlightened on the topic, how similar should the orders between my mods and plugin's priority be in MO2


[1/3/2026 1:46 PM] eldritch7838
can anyone tell me what the icons next to health mean? i only know one is for plates but idk what the others are


[1/3/2026 2:15 PM] gaijinjosh
Still have immense trouble trying to get this game going. I have 975/995 of mods downloaded, however, it's refusing to download the rest. I need help, don't know what else to do.


[1/3/2026 2:18 PM] eldritch7838
that happened to me, i just restarted wabbajack and installed again.


[1/3/2026 2:21 PM] gaijinjosh
Tried that, no results.


[1/3/2026 2:21 PM] gaijinjosh
Did it 6 times, no over exaggeration.


[1/3/2026 2:21 PM] eldritch7838
maybe relog into nexus?


[1/3/2026 2:21 PM] gaijinjosh
If there is someone that could call me privately and possibly assist me? I'd appreciate that. MAYBE.. there's something i'm overlooking


[1/3/2026 2:22 PM] eldritch7838
im just some dude lol, but that worked for me


[1/3/2026 2:26 PM] gaijinjosh
Is there a support tab?


[1/3/2026 2:43 PM] jupiterxvii
i just started a new playthrough and for whatever reason gun damage has been shaved by 90% at the start compared to my last one, anyone got experience with that?


[1/3/2026 2:43 PM] jupiterxvii
like the actual in pipboy stat, not like main or true damage modifiers


[1/3/2026 2:45 PM] jupiterxvii
and it was only the weapons found in vault 111 for some reason?? i just found a tinkers pistol and its normal


[1/3/2026 2:50 PM] jupiterxvii
ok nvm specific weapons are broken, the 44 deagle and the kimber custom 10mm


[1/3/2026 2:58 PM] swittens
Hey, what was the step needed to make Creation Club addons work with the list?


[1/3/2026 3:08 PM] darkwater4189
Which two files are you missing?


[1/3/2026 3:10 PM] 4ce_e
can someone help with the enb file?


[1/3/2026 3:15 PM] 4ce_e
I did the same stuff as the enb troubleshoot stuff, raw file no extracting


[1/3/2026 3:15 PM] 4ce_e
wabbajack just doesnt see it and removes it as soon as i retry download


[1/3/2026 3:16 PM] jupiterxvii
theres a github link around somewhere and it takes you to a text file that is just the actual link to download the enb


[1/3/2026 3:17 PM] 4ce_e
I already downloaded the ENB i need


[1/3/2026 3:17 PM] 4ce_e
I trying to put it in the folder manually but its the same thing everytime


[1/3/2026 3:17 PM] 4ce_e
removes it or marks it as missing


[1/3/2026 3:17 PM] jupiterxvii
yes i attempted multiple times from other sources and doing it this way was the only way that worked for me


[1/3/2026 3:17 PM] jupiterxvii
from wabbajack and from the enb site did not work, only the link at the github link worked for me


[1/3/2026 3:18 PM] 4ce_e
Where can i find it?


[1/3/2026 3:18 PM] 4ce_e
the github link

[1/3/2026 5:12 PM] ripluminescent
I downloaded it yesterday and it has been - fineish for me with the occasional glitch


[1/3/2026 5:14 PM] flameswift

[1/3/2026 5:37 PM] vinidia
Hey, I might be kinda dumb but the radiation system is giving me some trouble. I'm struggling to figure out how to clearly see what my current levels of radiation are. I've found the radiation device in the aid menu that shows me the level of IRA I'm at. I haven't been able to determine where rads are, though. I also keep hearing some voice saying something about IRA levels, but it's so quiet I can't understand it.


[1/3/2026 5:47 PM] vinidia
I found more information on the Nexus mod page and some googling. I think I get it more now. The RadBoy voice is super quiet though, and I'm not sure how to fix that.


[1/3/2026 6:09 PM] vinidia
Why does the gas mask icon in the top left keep flashing red over the cartridge? The condition is at 100% and using the repair menu (found under AID) indicates the gas mask is in good condition as well. I've seen the percentage go down and replaced the cartridges before to restore it, but I have no idea what this means :c


[1/3/2026 6:09 PM] ripluminescent
Think that may mean that it is being used? I think, genuinely unsure of that one but thats what I have been going off of.


[1/3/2026 6:10 PM] vinidia
ok ty <3

Hey all, just decided to check out this list. What FO4 game version do I need for the current wabbajack download?


[1/3/2026 7:38 PM] vinidia
you can just install it. Wabbajack has the capability to handle downgrades automatically. At least, well, I just installed it without any manual downgrades last night and I'm playing today.

What's the difference between the settings you pick at the start or a link to the differences


[1/3/2026 8:37 PM] vinidia
I was not expecting how difficult this list would be lol
I can't get through Concord like at all


[1/3/2026 8:37 PM] soarin_skys
You mean for the gasmasks?


[1/3/2026 8:37 PM] soarin_skys
The only preset setting that pops up at the start are the gas masks

✅

[1/3/2026 8:37 PM] vinidia
i would also like to know


[1/3/2026 8:38 PM] soarin_skys
It determines how much rads you get during weather


[1/3/2026 8:38 PM] soarin_skys
And how dangerous it is


[1/3/2026 8:38 PM] the0ats
Yeah the pop up in the pods


[1/3/2026 8:38 PM] soarin_skys
Anomaly default I have it set to that. When it rains and I dont have a mask on my rads shoot up by 40/sec


[1/3/2026 8:39 PM] vinidia
I want to disable immersive hud (hiding ui elements when not engaged), is that safe to do in this list?


[1/3/2026 8:40 PM] ripluminescent
First time I did it - was stupid hard. I finally got through it after a bunch of attempts but only after taking it in strides and saving when I could


[1/3/2026 8:41 PM] vinidia
Yeah, it's gonna be an adventure. I am actually a big fan of it so far. A lot of lists I've played before claim to be difficult, but this one actually feels like a challenge.


[1/3/2026 8:41 PM] ripluminescent
After learning the different save items it finally feels like death isn’t a chore


[1/3/2026 8:42 PM] vinidia
I know bed and survival pack, are there more?


[1/3/2026 8:42 PM] ripluminescent
Cigarettes


[1/3/2026 8:42 PM] soarin_skys
You can just adjust the setting in the mcm


[1/3/2026 8:43 PM] soarin_skys
Its safer than to disable it

[1/3/2026 8:43 PM] vinidia
That's what I usually do, but so many things in this list seem to be inter-connected I didn't want to break anything :p


[1/3/2026 8:43 PM] soarin_skys
I just put it so my compass is always on when my weapon is out


[1/3/2026 8:44 PM] vinidia
Makes sense. I just dislike the ui fading in and out all the time, so I like all of it to be always on, all the time :p


[1/3/2026 9:03 PM] ripluminescent
I’m praying that somewhere in this mod is the as Val - love that gun in any game

[1/4/2026 5:10 AM] einthecat
so I applied the MCM settings and everything is running good... but are the enemies supposed to be so tanky?


[1/4/2026 5:10 AM] einthecat
I even gave myself an AR and even the mole rats are taking a full clip to kill


[1/4/2026 6:57 AM] darkwater4189
I had that as well. 

Guns doing 3 damage or so. 
Makes no sense. Give a 5 year old a gun and let it shoot at me and im dead.

No gun/rifle skill needed. His reload speed, recoil handling etc are gonna suck (skill related) but damage wise, im dead. For me its a bad mechanic to fix difficulty like this.


[1/4/2026 7:01 AM] darkwater4189
Not sure if its the reason I have normal damage now, but I applied the immersive template.

My guns at low lvl do like 24-32 damage. Without skills and that works for me for things basic stuff like me rats.

They still hurt you (badly if your unlucky) but they will die in 2-3 shots. Makes much more sense to me since they are unarmored meatbags.


[1/4/2026 7:06 AM] streikeizer
Not really afaik. We had massive issues with non human enemies If I remember correct.


[1/4/2026 7:08 AM] kazifca
Do you know what mods might be causing that sort of issue?


[1/4/2026 7:09 AM] streikeizer
I dunno. Maybe some duplicate mods or something. One via esp and another via robco that do the same.


[1/4/2026 7:09 AM] streikeizer
I would have to look tbh.


[1/4/2026 7:10 AM] rockitao
Where is the closest doctor to Sanctuary? my character is fucked up with disease and IRA


[1/4/2026 7:10 AM] streikeizer
DC or Covenant I think.


[1/4/2026 7:10 AM] streikeizer
Sometimes its better to just restart the character ngl


[1/4/2026 7:11 AM] rockitao
damn, he is walking so slowly


[1/4/2026 7:11 AM] rockitao
well i might restart


[1/4/2026 7:11 AM] streikeizer
With the things you learnt maybe it goes better next time😅


[1/4/2026 7:12 AM] rockitao
yea it's my first playthrough... all went wrong because gas mask filter went to 0% for a couple of seconds


[1/4/2026 7:12 AM] rockitao
bad mistake lol


[1/4/2026 7:12 AM] kazifca
Would true damage/the anomaly weapon patches do it?


[1/4/2026 7:13 AM] streikeizer
No clue mate. I hope so. But I havent touched anomaly in 2 months beside updating the compile.


[1/4/2026 7:13 AM] streikeizer
So I gotta stick my fingers back into it if I want to see whats up


[1/4/2026 7:14 AM] kazifca

why is fps so low after you leave the vault?

and i have  a 5070ti gpu and my cpu is a 7 9800x3d


[1/4/2026 8:39 AM] soarin_skys
IRA slowly decreases when you have a mask on. I noticed that in my playthrough had 40 and it went back down to 1 after wearing a mask


[1/4/2026 8:39 AM] soarin_skys
Check the dmg


[1/4/2026 8:39 AM] soarin_skys
On your AR


[1/4/2026 8:40 AM] soarin_skys
If its just like 3-9


[1/4/2026 8:40 AM] soarin_skys
You gotta apply the mcm

Or the random mercenary caravan where 1 of the mercenaries is a doctor


[1/4/2026 8:46 AM] soarin_skys
Collect weapons and store them. Get scrapper maxed out with salvage and scrap the weapons and armor you stored. You get so many components and legendary chips


[1/4/2026 8:46 AM] soarin_skys
Start building up your armors. Get enough chips to make an armor have 5 enchantments on it

[1/4/2026 9:20 AM] soarin_skys

[1/4/2026 9:24 AM] ehsmkingwolf

[1/4/2026 9:25 AM] soarin_skys
It's a small cheese strat to unlock the gates that way but how hard this modpack is Ill take any advantage


[1/4/2026 9:25 AM] soarin_skys
Check enb


[1/4/2026 9:44 AM] ehsmkingwolf
how do i do that?


[1/4/2026 9:45 AM] soarin_skys
Shift enter I think it was


[1/4/2026 9:45 AM] soarin_skys
To open enb menu


[1/4/2026 9:45 AM] soarin_skys
Or was it home buttom


[1/4/2026 9:45 AM] soarin_skys
Check if fps is locked


[1/4/2026 9:47 AM] ehsmkingwolf
ok i will thanks


[1/4/2026 10:14 AM] tq.xv6
questuion.. installer fails at the end saying unable to download 1 archive... on the webpage it says if facing any issues do a manual install... did everyone here manual install?


[1/4/2026 10:19 AM] soarin_skys
Is it the enb


[1/4/2026 10:21 AM] ehsmkingwolf
@Soarin I did what you said still getting 60 fps outside


[1/4/2026 10:22 AM] soarin_skys
That's weird 😕


[1/4/2026 10:24 AM] ehsmkingwolf
Right it's like stuck on 120fps when I have a 240hz monitor


[1/4/2026 10:25 AM] ehsmkingwolf
But outside it's real choppy and between 90 and 60fps


[1/4/2026 10:25 AM] soarin_skys
I gotta check mine when i get home


[1/4/2026 10:26 AM] ehsmkingwolf
I don't have this problem with any other fallout 4 mod list


[1/4/2026 10:34 AM] streikeizer
I get between 60 and 90 aswell. Its not really choppy on my end. But I see what you mean.


[1/4/2026 10:35 AM] ehsmkingwolf
Right it's weird


[1/4/2026 10:36 AM] streikeizer
Thing is, there have been alot of major preformance updates since september this year. And these havent been used in the list so far


[1/4/2026 10:37 AM] streikeizer
At this point, I would need to update a shit ton of mods. Clean it all up. And insert said new preformance mods.


[1/4/2026 10:37 AM] ripluminescent
Should I be worried that I don’t have access to build any of the crafting tables in my game? Like when I go to my crafting tables tab the only one that is there is the engineering one.


[1/4/2026 10:38 AM] streikeizer
Not really you can unluck the other workbenches via schematics


[1/4/2026 10:39 AM] ripluminescent
Is that new?


[1/4/2026 10:40 AM] streikeizer
Been like that for a year tbh


[1/4/2026 10:41 AM] ripluminescent
Ok - the only reason I asked was because I started playing like 2 days ago but some weird loading glitch happened and I had to scrap the save and I had access to all of the crafting tables in that one - so when I started this one I was like “Uhhhh” 😂


[1/4/2026 10:42 AM] ripluminescent
Thank you!


[1/4/2026 10:51 AM] ehsmkingwolf
I got to work better now getting 120 fps outside now


[1/4/2026 11:00 AM] streikeizer
nice


[1/4/2026 11:31 AM] just_tucho
If i wanted to use a silent protagonist mod should i choose Silent Protagonist F4SE or F4z Ro D-oh - Silent Voice


[1/4/2026 12:08 PM] tq.xv6
starting to do a reinstall to have a better view of the logs because of pc reboot with ethernet im at 72% if anything goes wrong ill confirm if its enb


[1/4/2026 12:43 PM] adrelala
is 12ga shotgun shell crafted from a different workbench? I have over 100 of the ammo but don't see an option to craft a schematic from engineering workbench


[1/4/2026 12:48 PM] soarin_skys
You need overdue books to turn into crafting manuals


[1/4/2026 12:48 PM] soarin_skys
And you can go to the workbench in the tunnels


[1/4/2026 12:48 PM] soarin_skys
To craft the recipes


[1/4/2026 12:49 PM] soarin_skys
Ammo workbench


[1/4/2026 12:49 PM] soarin_skys
Or a perk


[1/4/2026 12:59 PM] gothicc_angel
I can't fucking believe a pastebin link in a discord fixed the issue I was having, Thank you lmao


[1/4/2026 1:09 PM] blissful_zen
hello folks! downloading the pack right now and looking forward to see how it checks out. Used to play Lost World back in the day...


[1/4/2026 1:11 PM] soarin_skys
Damn bro said thanks and dipped


[1/4/2026 1:11 PM] soarin_skys
Really fun


[1/4/2026 1:15 PM] adrelala
prob a perk since I don't see it in the ammo workbench


[1/4/2026 1:21 PM] soarin_skys
Yeah there are perks that unlock basic weapons to be crafted


[1/4/2026 1:21 PM] soarin_skys
Eitherway


[1/4/2026 1:21 PM] soarin_skys
I dont need to create ammo when arturo sells so much ammo


[1/4/2026 1:21 PM] soarin_skys
Got so much 556 for my MK12


[1/4/2026 1:22 PM] soarin_skys
That I dont need anything else


[1/4/2026 1:22 PM] soarin_skys
Heather is such a cheat skill. Shes like there as our isekai cheat power/item


[1/4/2026 1:22 PM] soarin_skys
Giving the best heals and a vendor you can sell crap to for easy caps


[1/4/2026 1:23 PM] soarin_skys
Can command her to unlock terminals for you and she levels up after every 5 terminals unlocked


[1/4/2026 1:23 PM] soarin_skys
So you dont need to dump points into science


[1/4/2026 1:24 PM] soarin_skys
I fucking love Heather. All my homies love Heather


[1/4/2026 1:25 PM] soarin_skys
If only her detox tea would act as a cleansing tonic. I modded her tea to act like a tonic because I feel like it should.


[1/4/2026 1:25 PM] soarin_skys
No more IRA poisoning

[1/4/2026 1:49 PM] clajmify.
Everytime my game auto saves it freezes any fixes?


[1/4/2026 1:50 PM] soarin_skys
Um you should only save by sleeping or smoking


[1/4/2026 1:50 PM] soarin_skys
Anything else is no good


[1/4/2026 1:50 PM] soarin_skys
Also


[1/4/2026 1:50 PM] soarin_skys
Yeah it does that it freezes 1 sec always


[1/4/2026 1:50 PM] soarin_skys
Dont worry about it


[1/4/2026 1:51 PM] clajmify.
nah full on freezes try to close the game nothing happens and just turns screen black


[1/4/2026 1:52 PM] clajmify.
it’s been a while since i’ve played but the mod organizer should auto update and what not no?


[1/4/2026 1:52 PM] clajmify.
well it does say there is a new version for download


[1/4/2026 2:28 PM] soarin_skys
You gotta go to wabbajack and do it again for it to update


[1/4/2026 2:29 PM] soarin_skys
Its faster


[1/4/2026 2:29 PM] soarin_skys
Since you already have the mods archived


[1/4/2026 2:30 PM] phlius255
Oh, after 10h of fixing enb error. This file is what was missing


[1/4/2026 2:31 PM] phlius255
Thanks


[1/4/2026 2:43 PM] clajmify.
okay i’m not even sure if i’m on the latest version like i said it’s been a while since ive played plus i’m not all the best with this mod stuff appreciate the help though


[1/4/2026 2:44 PM] littlet25
you can save by smoking are you fr


[1/4/2026 2:44 PM] soarin_skys
Yeah


[1/4/2026 2:44 PM] soarin_skys
Cigarettes are in aid


[1/4/2026 2:44 PM] littlet25
i wish it told you that man


[1/4/2026 2:48 PM] ripluminescent
I found that out and it’s like a new world for me


[1/4/2026 2:48 PM] ripluminescent
My character has become a full pack a day smoker


[1/4/2026 2:52 PM] clajmify.
there’s nothing in my wabbajack


[1/4/2026 2:53 PM] soarin_skys
Wut you just go to anomaly in Fallout 4 and install


[1/4/2026 2:53 PM] soarin_skys
You prob uninstalled wabbajack thinking you probably didnt need it amymore


[1/4/2026 2:54 PM] clajmify.
yea but when i install it ask me to make a new folder and what not


[1/4/2026 2:54 PM] kavik_0
Is there no way to take the APC directly to Sanctuary? It shows it as a location on the mod's map, but it only ever takes me to Red Rocket. Is this intentional?


[1/4/2026 2:54 PM] clajmify.
i have everything on mod organizer i’m still new to this mod stuff


[1/4/2026 2:57 PM] soarin_skys
Um just change it to your anomaly directory


[1/4/2026 2:57 PM] soarin_skys
And done


[1/4/2026 2:58 PM] soarin_skys
Don't expect driveable vehicles.


[1/4/2026 3:00 PM] kavik_0
I know that. I'm talking about the APC fast travel. The mod page shows Sanctuary as a location, but in the modpack, it's listed as Sanctuary/Red Rocket. I just want to know if that's intentional or I'm just stupid.


[1/4/2026 3:01 PM] soarin_skys
Well... modpack fixed it. Because originally its labeled as only Sanctuary but it doesnt take you to Sanctuary but near Red Rocket


[1/4/2026 3:01 PM] soarin_skys
Modpack just renamed it to avoid any confusion


[1/4/2026 3:01 PM] kavik_0
Thank you


[1/4/2026 3:14 PM] codenameburning
is it normal for the game to be so dark and saturated?


[1/4/2026 3:14 PM] codenameburning
I can barely see anything


[1/4/2026 3:19 PM] soarin_skys
Do you have a mask on?


[1/4/2026 3:19 PM] soarin_skys
Also it gets very dark at night


[1/4/2026 3:20 PM] soarin_skys
Need to get nightvision


[1/4/2026 3:20 PM] soarin_skys
Goggles


[1/4/2026 3:20 PM] soarin_skys
Or thermal


[1/4/2026 3:21 PM] clajmify.

[1/4/2026 3:21 PM] clajmify.
jeez


[1/4/2026 3:21 PM] just_tucho
My night vision goggles just stoped working. I havent really touched anything beyond adding the silent protagonist mod


[1/4/2026 3:22 PM] just_tucho
I havent tried turning the restarting the game yet


[1/4/2026 3:23 PM] dochevski
god this modpack looks amazing


[1/4/2026 3:23 PM] dochevski
i love it so far


[1/4/2026 3:24 PM] soarin_skys
Shift U I think is to toggle on and off


[1/4/2026 3:24 PM] just_tucho
I allready tried that but thank you


[1/4/2026 3:25 PM] soarin_skys
Btw any extra mods added that is not part of the modpack voids any support

Does anyone know what % each segment of your rad meter is? I haven't gotten any more than five full but I'm assuming its 10%.


[1/4/2026 3:51 PM] ned4903
wantin to be a ghoulie


[1/4/2026 3:52 PM] soarin_skys
Its out of 1000


[1/4/2026 3:53 PM] soarin_skys
So 100 rads is 10%


[1/4/2026 3:53 PM] ned4903
nice okay, good to know its the same then


[1/4/2026 3:53 PM] ned4903
thank you


[1/4/2026 3:53 PM] jaegerdaddy
hi all, been dowloading for a few hours manually adding each mods, its taking quite a while. Can anyone tell me how many mods I gotta add and download before its done? I cant seem to find it anywhere


[1/4/2026 3:54 PM] soarin_skys
Um


[1/4/2026 3:55 PM] soarin_skys
It should automatically do it. Only thing you have to do is


[1/4/2026 3:55 PM] ned4903
are you doin it without nexus premium?


[1/4/2026 3:55 PM] soarin_skys
Downgrade unless its been updated to the point where you dont need to downgrade and it does it for you. The only mod you need to get is the enb from the pastebin


[1/4/2026 3:55 PM] soarin_skys
Everything else is auto


[1/4/2026 3:55 PM] jaegerdaddy
yes


[1/4/2026 3:55 PM] ned4903
oh


[1/4/2026 3:55 PM] soarin_skys
There should never be an instance where you have to manual any other mods


[1/4/2026 3:55 PM] soarin_skys
Oh


[1/4/2026 3:56 PM] soarin_skys
Damn No premium


[1/4/2026 3:56 PM] soarin_skys
How much does it go for anyways


[1/4/2026 3:56 PM] ned4903
thats a rough one as I've never done that. does it pop up a window per mod for you?


[1/4/2026 3:56 PM] jaegerdaddy
yeah it does and i gotta click download everytime


[1/4/2026 3:57 PM] jaegerdaddy
not gonna buy premium in this economy when all i want is to check this modpack out. Wouldnt use it for anything else anyway


[1/4/2026 3:57 PM] soarin_skys
I just checked


[1/4/2026 3:58 PM] ned4903
okay then, with the few i downloaded manually in previous lists It should specifically tell you what mod to download in the black bar at the top right?


[1/4/2026 3:58 PM] soarin_skys
And I got lifetime 6 years ago today. Wow what are the odds


[1/4/2026 3:58 PM] ned4903
If so and you just wanna know how many mods there are, aren't there like over 700+?


[1/4/2026 3:59 PM] jaegerdaddy
there is a number top middle say 303/972 downloading filed. I am hoping that aint the number of mods thats why i asked here xd


[1/4/2026 3:59 PM] ned4903
oh yeah, thats how many you gotta do


[1/4/2026 3:59 PM] ned4903
its brutal


[1/4/2026 4:00 PM] jaegerdaddy
fuckin hell people with premium how long did it take for you all?


[1/4/2026 4:00 PM] ned4903
I've only had to do it with like 50+ mods but that wasn't too bad


[1/4/2026 4:01 PM] ned4903
for me personally, roughly 2 1/2 to 3 hours I believe


[1/4/2026 4:01 PM] ned4903
prolly less but im bein generous


[1/4/2026 4:01 PM] jaegerdaddy
well i ahve been at it for that long, i think current pace capped at like 3mb/s speed gonna take me 9 hours or so


[1/4/2026 4:01 PM] jaegerdaddy
insane


[1/4/2026 4:01 PM] just_tucho
Premium users taking 1% of a non premium user's pain


[1/4/2026 4:02 PM] soarin_skys
It took like 4 hours


[1/4/2026 4:02 PM] ned4903
premium is definitely worth, i just get a month, and then cancel


[1/4/2026 4:02 PM] soarin_skys
Its $9 now wow


[1/4/2026 4:02 PM] soarin_skys
I remember when lifetime was like a solid $35 back in my day


[1/4/2026 4:02 PM] ned4903
yeah i can only imagine the hell that is lmao

[1/4/2026 4:03 PM] jaegerdaddy
real average good salary around here a month is 800 euroes dude


[1/4/2026 4:03 PM] soarin_skys
I mean 8 euroes for it to auto download the mod pack so you can do something else and have the modpack ready for hundreds of hours of fun


[1/4/2026 4:03 PM] jaegerdaddy
and my rent is cheap around 330 euro


[1/4/2026 4:03 PM] soarin_skys
I say thats a win


[1/4/2026 4:04 PM] jaegerdaddy
i have no clue if im gonna uninstall it after 10 hours or not xd

[1/4/2026 4:05 PM] just_tucho
Not for long if spain has anything to say about it


[1/4/2026 4:05 PM] just_tucho
Pretty similar here


[1/4/2026 4:06 PM] jaegerdaddy

HUF nearly 400 equals a Euro


[1/4/2026 4:09 PM] just_tucho
So 400million= 1 million euros right?


[1/4/2026 4:11 PM] einthecat
sorry to interrupt but really quick question, if im adding some additional armors to the modpack, do I need to run bodyslide to apply them? had some bad experiences with some skyrim modpacks and bodyslide


[1/4/2026 4:11 PM] jaegerdaddy
around that


[1/4/2026 4:11 PM] just_tucho
Shit happens


[1/4/2026 4:12 PM] iemtasty
hello


[1/4/2026 4:13 PM] jaegerdaddy
yeah i guess, if i robbed a store for 200-300 euroes i would go to jail for years and years, politicans steal millions? Nothing ever happens, getting kinda tired of it


[1/4/2026 4:14 PM] jaegerdaddy
anyways sorry for ranting, my last question how large is the modpack gonna be? Around 100 gb?


[1/4/2026 4:15 PM] ned4903
276gb


[1/4/2026 4:15 PM] just_tucho
Yep 276


[1/4/2026 4:15 PM] just_tucho
Do you have an ssd?


[1/4/2026 4:15 PM] jaegerdaddy

[1/4/2026 4:15 PM] jaegerdaddy
i couldnt see that anywhere on the site


[1/4/2026 4:16 PM] ned4903
i think when you hover over the list it'll pop up in the corner


[1/4/2026 4:16 PM] ned4903
if you're using wabbajack


[1/4/2026 4:16 PM] jaegerdaddy
yeah but i am not putting that there, not even stalker gamma is on there and runs "fine" enough


[1/4/2026 4:17 PM] jaegerdaddy
all it say there is preparation and that i got 305/972


[1/4/2026 4:19 PM] vividextent
I dont pay for premium i have legacy


[1/4/2026 4:20 PM] ned4903
the mod thumbnail says 194gb in the bottom right so not even that is correct lol


[1/4/2026 4:20 PM] ned4903
either way, total is still 276


[1/4/2026 4:21 PM] vividextent
but i have been threatend to get my acc closed.


[1/4/2026 4:22 PM] ned4903
what was legacy, one price for a permanent license?


[1/4/2026 4:23 PM] vividextent
Legacy is for the people who payed the 60$ for permanent premium acc.


[1/4/2026 4:24 PM] vividextent
I bought it five years befor the sale I was just using the site alot and thought it was worth the price.


[1/4/2026 4:24 PM] knowing_goyim

But I cant wait for more ppl to use DEG and  Based Mods


[1/4/2026 4:30 PM] vividextent
Hopefully one of them can knock Nexus down a peg


[1/4/2026 4:39 PM] 14ay6
Ahhh thank you kindly sir


[1/4/2026 4:39 PM] 14ay6
Yeah. I hate how greedy it has become


[1/4/2026 4:39 PM] 14ay6
Well I have faith in AyakaMods


[1/4/2026 4:40 PM] 14ay6
Hopefully in few years it becomes more popular


[1/4/2026 4:41 PM] einthecat
What is limiting cheat engines other menus from appearing in game?


[1/4/2026 4:41 PM] einthecat
*cheat terminals


[1/4/2026 4:41 PM] 14ay6

Hi guys, I’ve played for 5 hours total and I just took Concord (after 10 deaths?). I let the minutemen do 75% the work. Now all of my ammo is spent, my aid is out and im full of rads. 

I try and go scavenging for resources but each encounter is decided whether or not I stumble over. Am I just supposed to die now? And my gas mask is almost broke.. Any tips?


[1/4/2026 4:56 PM] dochevski
anyone got a good spot for cigs?


[1/4/2026 4:59 PM] soarin_skys
Anywhere pretty much. I just open the packs and cartons of cigarettes


[1/4/2026 4:59 PM] soarin_skys
And have like 50 of them


[1/4/2026 5:17 PM] riseraakasha
anyone every try any other enbs out on this modlist?


[1/4/2026 5:32 PM] holdentudics
Hows it going yall


[1/4/2026 5:54 PM] soarin_skys
I'm afraid to try


[1/4/2026 6:01 PM] littlet25
what do you do against internal bleeding


[1/4/2026 6:04 PM] soarin_skys
I used heather's bone meal. I think quickclot might do the trick


[1/4/2026 6:09 PM] georgebodge
if you keeps stumbling over will be due to rads so you need to go to a doctor to cure it or build a Decontamination arch at a settlement. best place for a dco is diamond city or covenant


[1/4/2026 6:10 PM] peanuts1582
alright will stumble to diamond city then 👍


[1/4/2026 6:16 PM] 14ay6
I wanna ask. Can I install better locational damage ? Or is there a mod already exist like an alternative of it in the modpack ?


[1/4/2026 6:17 PM] soarin_skys
I can suggest a little cheese


[1/4/2026 6:17 PM] soarin_skys
Little cheeky strat


[1/4/2026 6:17 PM] 14ay6
I don't want enemies to be bullet spongy.


[1/4/2026 6:17 PM] soarin_skys
Go to the abandoned tunnels


[1/4/2026 6:17 PM] soarin_skys
The sanctuary manhole


[1/4/2026 6:17 PM] 14ay6
I like difficulty but in a good way instead of bullet spongue


[1/4/2026 6:18 PM] soarin_skys
Go to the diamond city gate look between the gate to take off the chain from the other side. Go to diamond city and spend some caps there


[1/4/2026 6:18 PM] soarin_skys
Restock


[1/4/2026 6:18 PM] soarin_skys
It takes you to diamond city right away avoiding any danger and getting access to vendors


[1/4/2026 6:19 PM] soarin_skys
Like arturo and a doctor


[1/4/2026 6:19 PM] soarin_skys
Because after concord you can go to the diner yeah but the random dogs or raiders on the road might be rough


[1/4/2026 6:19 PM] calicojack_2205
How do you throw grenades?


[1/4/2026 6:20 PM] soarin_skys
Hold


[1/4/2026 6:20 PM] soarin_skys
The bash button


[1/4/2026 6:20 PM] soarin_skys
Left alt


[1/4/2026 6:20 PM] soarin_skys
But equip them first


[1/4/2026 6:22 PM] calicojack_2205
Thanx


[1/4/2026 6:32 PM] peanuts1582
Cheers, I like this mod but it’s hard to not cheat sometimes, I did have to use savegame & add.item for cleansing tonic or I would’ve dropped it..


[1/4/2026 6:33 PM] soarin_skys
A little advantage


[1/4/2026 6:33 PM] soarin_skys
We'll get to diamond city eventually just speed up the process avoid any headaches


[1/4/2026 8:11 PM] codenameburning
This game got me playing fallout like it's Tarkov.  So intense


[1/4/2026 8:26 PM] soarin_skys
DLC enemies have like wallhacks


[1/4/2026 8:26 PM] soarin_skys
Rust devils can spot me in the dark from 100m away and while i have 100 sneak


[1/4/2026 8:27 PM] soarin_skys
Need to get more stealth enchantments to prevent detection


[1/4/2026 10:17 PM] perinthia
Is there a way to change the zoom with sniper scopes? Like press a button and the scroll wheel or something


[1/4/2026 10:46 PM] darthsawyer
I'm trying to link this in the support forum for someone who had my same issue but I keep getting automodded, very annoying


[1/4/2026 10:47 PM] darthsawyer
There we go, thank god for the edit button


[1/4/2026 11:11 PM] kavik_0
Anybody know what would've caused some, but not all, of my textures to become horrendously low? I walk through the woods and half of the trees are 2D.


[1/4/2026 11:23 PM] jupiterxvii
sometimes the LODs break, a game reboot typically fixes it for me


[1/4/2026 11:32 PM] baccano1713
Started to play again after a year and the deathclaw that spawns in concord during the tutorial got one shot by a raider :pepethink:


[1/5/2026 4:13 AM] ska.08
Just started this modpack. Is my damage bugged? starting kimber does 3 damage and headshots are not 1 shoting mole rats with maim?


[1/5/2026 4:29 AM] ska.08
nvm reboot made my damage go to 31


[1/5/2026 4:39 AM] feetloverr
Hey guys, this may be a stupid question, but can I delete the download folder in wabbajack after installing everything?


[1/5/2026 5:49 AM] eldritchwat
what ammo does the anti-tank rifle take? because i tried the 20mm autocannon ammo and it didnt take


[1/5/2026 6:42 AM] 14ay6
Is there a way to like remove radiation ? I'm continuously getting hit by random radiation or something and losing my health


[1/5/2026 6:42 AM] 14ay6
I'm new to this modpack so I kinda need more time to adjust


[1/5/2026 6:46 AM] 14ay6
It's like I'm just walking and continuously becoming weak or dizzy or something. Idk why is that. If you guys, can you name the mod so I can disable it for now ? Game is already difficult enough


[1/5/2026 6:47 AM] jupiterxvii
can you explain what you mean by immerisive template and how you went about applying it? tx


[1/5/2026 6:52 AM] niqzu
Check your IRA levels?


[1/5/2026 7:06 AM] jupiterxvii
just bricked a save cuz my dog has become uninteractable, any one have a fix?


[1/5/2026 8:08 AM] soarin_skys
Yes but if you want to reinstall anomaly it wont be faster. But Idk if anomaly will receive any updates so


[1/5/2026 8:08 AM] soarin_skys
Yeah i say yes


[1/5/2026 8:09 AM] soarin_skys
There is a radboy aid item


[1/5/2026 8:09 AM] soarin_skys
Use it to check your IRA level


[1/5/2026 8:09 AM] soarin_skys
IRA is separate from radiation


[1/5/2026 8:09 AM] soarin_skys
You need to wear gas masks in yhis mod or else you'll die lol


[1/5/2026 8:11 AM] soarin_skys
Hmmm was he down and you tried to stim?


[1/5/2026 8:13 AM] soarin_skys
If they do 3 dmg then the anomaly mcm preset hasnt been applied.


[1/5/2026 8:13 AM] soarin_skys
If weapons do 3 dmg or 300 dmg that means something isnt right


[1/5/2026 8:13 AM] soarin_skys
Need to be in between


[1/5/2026 8:19 AM] 14ay6
I keep getting that red body like symbol in the background and I can't run. How do you fix that ?


[1/5/2026 8:19 AM] soarin_skys
You're crippled


[1/5/2026 8:20 AM] soarin_skys
Ipak then ibuprofen


[1/5/2026 8:20 AM] soarin_skys
Or a doctor


[1/5/2026 8:20 AM] soarin_skys
Or Heather's Brahmin meal


[1/5/2026 8:21 AM] soarin_skys
I say rush towards Heather Casdin right away to get her benefits


[1/5/2026 8:21 AM] soarin_skys
:blob_yes:


[1/5/2026 8:23 AM] 14ay6
Is there a way to like disable that ? I mean idk why I keep becoming crippled lol. I kinda wanna take it easy just for now then get used to difficulty


[1/5/2026 8:23 AM] soarin_skys
Are you overemcombured?


[1/5/2026 8:23 AM] soarin_skys
Carrying too much?


[1/5/2026 8:24 AM] soarin_skys
That can cripple you. Also taking an ipak and no ibuprofen after will recripple you


[1/5/2026 8:24 AM] soarin_skys
If you sprint


[1/5/2026 8:24 AM] soarin_skys
You really shouldn't be crippled 24/7 uhhh theres also adamantium skeleton perk


[1/5/2026 8:24 AM] soarin_skys
Get it to tier 3 and bye bye cripple


[1/5/2026 8:25 AM] soarin_skys
And if you want to take it easy


[1/5/2026 8:25 AM] soarin_skys
I highly suggest to use a cheese strat


[1/5/2026 8:26 AM] soarin_skys
Like intant access to diamond city by going to the abandoned tunnels in the sanctuary manhole.

Go to the diamond city gate look in between the gate to take off the chain and boom instant access to diamond city for vendors


[1/5/2026 8:29 AM] soarin_skys
This modpak is hard but can be cheesed


[1/5/2026 8:34 AM] 14ay6
How do I use esp explorer ? I assume it's already installed. What's the hotkey ?


[1/5/2026 8:34 AM] soarin_skys
Huh its in here? I never even knew it was lmao


[1/5/2026 8:34 AM] 14ay6
Lol


[1/5/2026 8:34 AM] soarin_skys
I need to check the button if it is


[1/5/2026 8:36 AM] darkwater4189
Multiple people have reported that sometimes, even after applying the preset the damage still stays at 3 or so.
Look at this clip at 43 seconds where he applies the preset but later, while fighting the mole rats at Red Rocket he does almost no damage and he empties all his ammo on the mole rats:

https://www.youtube.com/live/AVadgrUK7zQ?si=GRG_eoy-pFVenxnS

This has been my experience as well on my first playrhough and the expierence of the guy reporting this as well.
I have tried reproducing it but i can't so that makes it annoying but at least in this YouTube clip you can see it on 'video'.

It not just people not doing what the instructions tell them to do, maybe it a timing issue or a combination of perks(?)


[1/5/2026 8:37 AM] soarin_skys
Nah its a load order issue more than likely. Its weird. Everything is all tied to true dmg. The conplexsorter should be the last thing that changes the ammo dmg


[1/5/2026 8:37 AM] soarin_skys
Complexsorter*


[1/5/2026 8:38 AM] soarin_skys
Its weird


[1/5/2026 8:38 AM] soarin_skys
I had what you had before


[1/5/2026 8:38 AM] soarin_skys
Weapons doing 3 dmg for no reason at the start


[1/5/2026 8:38 AM] soarin_skys
Sometimes I died and they start doing 3000 dmg


[1/5/2026 8:38 AM] soarin_skys
Its weird. Right now my weapons are fine


[1/5/2026 8:39 AM] soarin_skys
No low dmg or high dmg. Dunno what I didother than check xedit to see if anything is overriding the ammo


[1/5/2026 8:41 AM] darkwater4189
Yes it's annoying, since im new and this was my first playthrough on this modlist i almost deleted the whole list.
This is a 'hard list' 'yeah no they just damage sponse' was my first thought. 😂 

Glad I restarted and made new char and then it was fine.


[1/5/2026 8:41 AM] soarin_skys
I checked and it was fine so I was like wtf


[1/5/2026 8:41 AM] soarin_skys
Oh yeah that fixes it too


[1/5/2026 8:41 AM] soarin_skys
Somehow


[1/5/2026 8:57 AM] furion268
hello! with my 3840 x 2160 monitor i have issues when running with 150%, works with 100%

The guide mentions to configure the resolution in BethINI, where is this found?


[1/5/2026 8:58 AM] furion268
my bad, i found it, but it already is set correctly


[1/5/2026 9:00 AM] furion268
going full screen works as well, I will go with that


[1/5/2026 9:15 AM] streikeizer
Im fucking around with the true dmg etc to see if I can replicatie it mystlf


[1/5/2026 9:57 AM] jaegerdaddy
Guys quick question, after my instal finishes and I am sure the game runs, can I delete the downloaded mods? its 130gigs sitting unpacked in a folder if i dont need it to run the game i dont want it

[1/5/2026 10:47 AM] soarin_skys
100% there arent that many trees


[1/5/2026 10:48 AM] soarin_skys
I played genesis before. Absolutely beautiful so many trees and environment but crashing due to some outdated mods


[1/5/2026 10:48 AM] soarin_skys
Sadge


[1/5/2026 10:48 AM] soarin_skys
This version of anomaly is super stable


[1/5/2026 10:48 AM] moudy9547
yeah thats my fear


[1/5/2026 10:48 AM] soarin_skys
Havent crashed yet


[1/5/2026 10:48 AM] moudy9547
so just the harbor one?


[1/5/2026 10:48 AM] soarin_skys
And automaton


[1/5/2026 10:49 AM] soarin_skys
I am unsure about workshop


[1/5/2026 10:49 AM] soarin_skys
Let me read


[1/5/2026 10:49 AM] soarin_skys
DLC requirements
DLC name
Automatron
Contraptions Workshop
Far Harbor
Nuka World
Vault-Tec Workshop
Wasteland Workshop


[1/5/2026 10:49 AM] moudy9547
gadamn i wasnt planning to spend that much money on it


[1/5/2026 10:49 AM] soarin_skys
Thats all


[1/5/2026 10:50 AM] soarin_skys
Creation club stuff not needed


[1/5/2026 10:50 AM] soarin_skys
Pretty much all the base game dlcs


[1/5/2026 10:50 AM] soarin_skys
No anniversary edition crap


[1/5/2026 10:51 AM] soarin_skys
:Iheartyou:


[1/5/2026 10:51 AM] moudy9547
damn alr:Cool_Finger_Guns_Crying:


[1/5/2026 10:51 AM] moudy9547
finna buy it i guess


[1/5/2026 10:52 AM] moudy9547
i could crack it from the start but already bought the base game


[1/5/2026 10:52 AM] moudy9547
also chatgpt say that the standard edition was good enough


[1/5/2026 10:53 AM] soarin_skys
Bruh


[1/5/2026 10:53 AM] moudy9547
dont even like ai


[1/5/2026 10:53 AM] soarin_skys
I got the requirements from the official anomaly nexus page


[1/5/2026 10:55 AM] moudy9547
the versione "game of the year" got all dlc required right?


[1/5/2026 10:58 AM] soarin_skys
Yeah


[1/5/2026 10:58 AM] moudy9547
wait i have 1 minute played, i could do a refund and but that version


[1/5/2026 10:58 AM] moudy9547
and download the missing one


[1/5/2026 11:02 AM] soarin_skys
Which ever works for you


[1/5/2026 11:22 AM] 14ay6
Uh. How do you heal your hands ? Sorry if this is a dumb question guy stimpak isn't working for body parts for some reason


[1/5/2026 11:23 AM] 14ay6
I like details but... I wish I could turn off certain mechanics such as hand damage leading to no heavy arm


[1/5/2026 11:23 AM] 14ay6
@Soarin you might know


[1/5/2026 11:25 AM] soarin_skys
You use stimpaks to heal hp. To heal crippled limbs you need a specific item that heals limps like a splint or ipak. Ibuprofen heals damaged limbs but no broken limbs


[1/5/2026 11:25 AM] soarin_skys
Heather is the best companion to have. You can buy her bone meal to heal hp and heal crippled limbs


[1/5/2026 11:26 AM] soarin_skys
Its expensive tho


[1/5/2026 11:33 AM] 14ay6
Okay so uh... How do you turn that option off ? I get the idea of realism, but it's too frustrating for me lol


[1/5/2026 11:34 AM] 14ay6
At least rn I'm too earlie in the game to continue like this


[1/5/2026 11:34 AM] soarin_skys
Uhh i think maim but its really not that big of a deal. I dont want to mess anything up that would result in crashes so I just live with it


[1/5/2026 11:34 AM] soarin_skys
I mean in hardcore new vegas


[1/5/2026 11:34 AM] soarin_skys
You need doctors bags


[1/5/2026 11:34 AM] soarin_skys
To heal crippled limbs


[1/5/2026 11:35 AM] 14ay6
Oh yeah. It's just that I think it would work better if we went slightly further in the game. You know when you're actually prepared somewhat


[1/5/2026 11:36 AM] soarin_skys
You just gotta take firefights carefully. Sneak is your best friend. If you get a silenced weapon ita gonna carry


[1/5/2026 11:36 AM] soarin_skys
Against raiders you need to pick them off 1 by 1


[1/5/2026 11:37 AM] 14ay6
I wanna ask

Do you all facing any weird graphic glitches ? Like I'm in Concord and textures are often disappearing then popping up again


[1/5/2026 11:37 AM] soarin_skys
Lets see what I did early game


[1/5/2026 11:37 AM] soarin_skys
Uhh I went and got the grenades from the mailbox in sanctuary


[1/5/2026 11:37 AM] soarin_skys
Grouped up the zombies


[1/5/2026 11:37 AM] soarin_skys
Threw the grenade


[1/5/2026 11:38 AM] soarin_skys
And cleared the first wave in concord


[1/5/2026 11:38 AM] soarin_skys
As for the raiders. I started with a hunting rifle


[1/5/2026 11:38 AM] soarin_skys
So I could pick them off from the roof


[1/5/2026 11:38 AM] soarin_skys
There is a rope that leads to the roof


[1/5/2026 11:38 AM] 14ay6
Oh yeah I love your profile


[1/5/2026 11:38 AM] soarin_skys
Next to the mr handy in concord


[1/5/2026 11:39 AM] soarin_skys
You can snipe the raiders and wait


[1/5/2026 11:39 AM] soarin_skys
Take them out 1 by 1


[1/5/2026 11:39 AM] soarin_skys
Then pick the rest of the loot


[1/5/2026 11:39 AM] moudy9547
i dowwnload the dlcs


[1/5/2026 11:39 AM] soarin_skys
Nice

[1/5/2026 11:39 AM] soarin_skys
Do it again idk why but


[1/5/2026 11:40 AM] soarin_skys
If it fails because of another thing


[1/5/2026 11:40 AM] moudy9547

finaly


[1/5/2026 11:41 AM] 14ay6
Yeah I installed my game just yesterday. Had the same problem


[1/5/2026 11:41 AM] soarin_skys
Before you enter the museum


[1/5/2026 11:41 AM] soarin_skys
I would run towards heather


[1/5/2026 11:41 AM] soarin_skys
To get her affinity up early


[1/5/2026 11:42 AM] soarin_skys
Between there and her it should only be the molerats from the junkyard


[1/5/2026 11:42 AM] soarin_skys
Oh and maybe a random encounter


[1/5/2026 11:42 AM] soarin_skys
Hopefully it aint raiders


[1/5/2026 11:43 AM] soarin_skys
Just careful with grenades. Cover wont help you. The dmg goes through cover so you need to get away from the indicator


[1/5/2026 11:44 AM] soarin_skys
Mines also


[1/5/2026 11:44 AM] soarin_skys
Lmao i died so many times to mines


[1/5/2026 11:44 AM] soarin_skys
I rushed that light footing perk right away


[1/5/2026 11:44 AM] soarin_skys
So I dont trigfer any mines


[1/5/2026 11:51 AM] mikekockiner
Had the same issue, will this version of v0501 work instead of the v0501 that is on the enb site? Cause i put the enb site's version in my downloads and it never worked


[1/5/2026 11:55 AM] moudy9547
can i delete the mods zip after the install


[1/5/2026 11:55 AM] moudy9547
cuz its quiet a lot space all combine


[1/5/2026 11:57 AM] soarin_skys
Yes


[1/5/2026 11:58 AM] soarin_skys
Its only there to make updating anomaly faster


[1/5/2026 11:58 AM] soarin_skys
Dont think there will be any updates anytime soon so


[1/5/2026 11:58 AM] soarin_skys
And this update is super stable


[1/5/2026 11:58 AM] soarin_skys
So yeah you can delete


[1/5/2026 12:16 PM] confoundedotter
Alright boys


[1/5/2026 12:17 PM] confoundedotter
First things first I got jumpscared by the 350GB requirement, how much of that is just 4K retextures and the such, I need to know if I can save up any decent amount of space because I don't want my F04 folder to end up like my Skyrim one


[1/5/2026 12:17 PM] confoundedotter
Rough estimate


[1/5/2026 12:19 PM] sirtronomodo
It's more like 150 for the mod + 150 for the downloads, which you can delete after install


[1/5/2026 12:19 PM] confoundedotter
Well that's a relief


[1/5/2026 12:19 PM] confoundedotter
My GAMMA install is already bad enough


[1/5/2026 12:20 PM] confoundedotter
I've been out of the loop with Fallout modding for like the past years though so I'll have to figure out if there are still 100 different balancing mods ecosystems


[1/5/2026 12:26 PM] sirtronomodo
My GPU load reaches its limit in some areas, is there any way to reduce this?


[1/5/2026 1:00 PM] soarin_skys
Wow really?


[1/5/2026 1:00 PM] moudy9547
can i extract bigger mods manually and delete it roght after?


[1/5/2026 1:00 PM] soarin_skys
No


[1/5/2026 1:00 PM] soarin_skys
You gotta let wabbajack do its thing


[1/5/2026 1:00 PM] soarin_skys
Then delete


[1/5/2026 1:01 PM] moudy9547
not possible i think


[1/5/2026 1:01 PM] soarin_skys
Damn not enough space


[1/5/2026 1:01 PM] soarin_skys
Time to uninstall games


[1/5/2026 1:01 PM] moudy9547
my ssd only 500gb


[1/5/2026 1:01 PM] moudy9547
i dont think its even possible


[1/5/2026 1:01 PM] moudy9547
but i gpt am hdd w 3 tb


[1/5/2026 1:02 PM] confoundedotter
You can probably install it on the HDD then transfer everything but the downloads folder but it will install comically slow


[1/5/2026 1:02 PM] confoundedotter
MO2 has a stroke with HDDs and big mods


[1/5/2026 1:02 PM] moudy9547
that what i was thinkin


[1/5/2026 1:02 PM] moudy9547
im stuck

Better than nothing


[1/5/2026 1:02 PM] soarin_skys
Or or


[1/5/2026 1:02 PM] confoundedotter
You can also just install FO4 and mod it manually


[1/5/2026 1:03 PM] moudy9547
soarin said it no


[1/5/2026 1:03 PM] confoundedotter
Tho 772 mods is a lot


[1/5/2026 1:03 PM] soarin_skys
Yeah and they gotta be specific version


[1/5/2026 1:03 PM] soarin_skys
AND


[1/5/2026 1:03 PM] soarin_skys
The anomaly patches


[1/5/2026 1:03 PM] moudy9547
300gb for a mod pack lowkey evil tho


[1/5/2026 1:03 PM] soarin_skys
And the load order


[1/5/2026 1:04 PM] moudy9547
:blob_yes:


[1/5/2026 1:04 PM] confoundedotter
You think that's bad


[1/5/2026 1:04 PM] soarin_skys
Which is why its not good to manual because its


[1/5/2026 1:04 PM] soarin_skys
Just bad


[1/5/2026 1:04 PM] moudy9547
what i can do:Cool_Finger_Guns_Crying:


[1/5/2026 1:04 PM] confoundedotter
Stalker GAMMA takes what is essentially a 2009 game and somehow creates a 200+ GB folder


[1/5/2026 1:04 PM] soarin_skys
Make enough room


[1/5/2026 1:04 PM] soarin_skys
Smh


[1/5/2026 1:04 PM] moudy9547

[1/5/2026 1:05 PM] moudy9547

[1/5/2026 1:05 PM] moudy9547
tried appdata file etc


[1/5/2026 1:05 PM] moudy9547
but not enough space still


[1/5/2026 1:05 PM] confoundedotter
Install Wiztree and let it analyze your drive


[1/5/2026 1:05 PM] confoundedotter
Still just install to HDD and transfer maybe


[1/5/2026 1:08 PM] moudy9547
bruh why do a google folder have 30gb


[1/5/2026 1:08 PM] moudy9547
this crazy


[1/5/2026 1:08 PM] confoundedotter
One Drive backup?


[1/5/2026 1:08 PM] moudy9547
i have no idea


[1/5/2026 1:08 PM] moudy9547
investigating rn


[1/5/2026 2:08 PM] streikeizer
I figured out whats the issue of the 3 DMG baton. YAE uses weaponary as skill for dmg increase with melee weapons. Aswell as True damage. In the MCM settings, Its set to 1.0 damage output. Changing that to 3.0 gives it 11 dmg.
Gonna fuck around with it some more aswell as alot of more basic things. And see what's the diffrence in the end.


[1/5/2026 2:08 PM] littlet25
is casdin distress signal supposed to be silent?


[1/5/2026 2:09 PM] streikeizer
I think its bugged or something.


[1/5/2026 2:10 PM] littlet25
am i able to still get her without the quest?


[1/5/2026 2:10 PM] streikeizer
Afaik you can


[1/5/2026 2:13 PM] darkwater4189
Really cool you looked into it, and found something! 
If I can test anything let me know.


[1/5/2026 2:16 PM] clajmify.
Would anyone be able to give me a hand with updating the mods i’m having a hard time and feel like i’m just fucking shit up


[1/5/2026 2:31 PM] soarin_skys
Yes. Its bugged but you cam still talk to her


[1/5/2026 2:31 PM] soarin_skys

[1/5/2026 3:12 PM] 14ay6
@Soarin sort of blurry. Know how to fix this ? (Sorry for tagging)


[1/5/2026 3:14 PM] soarin_skys
Either you got foureyes trait or have the vignette from the gas mask being on


[1/5/2026 3:15 PM] soarin_skys
Or depth of field is on


[1/5/2026 3:15 PM] soarin_skys
I turn it off


[1/5/2026 3:15 PM] 14ay6
Did you fix it ?


[1/5/2026 3:15 PM] 14ay6
I'm reading it's the enb. Which option in enb ?


[1/5/2026 3:16 PM] soarin_skys
Shift enter


[1/5/2026 3:16 PM] soarin_skys
Disable depth of field


[1/5/2026 3:16 PM] 14ay6

doggin

[1/5/2026 7:44 PM] clajmify.
what did u do for it to work?


[1/5/2026 7:46 PM] zaja0479
the version on the website won't work for the install. @Leaving School posted a link in the support forum under the ENB issue ticket that gives you a link to the proper version needed. drag and drop into downloads folder. before i found it, when i downloaded 0.501 off the enb website it would instant delete when i would try the install. no issues with the one @Leaving School provided though.


[1/5/2026 7:46 PM] feetloverr
need an older ENB model


[1/5/2026 7:48 PM] clajmify.
perfect i know it might be a long shot but when you downloaded from wabbajack did u have a hard time finding the mod organizer ?


[1/5/2026 7:49 PM] zaja0479
my game is still installing but no it should be in the install folder that you designate before the download and installing of mods. once it all installs should be in that folder


[1/5/2026 7:50 PM] clajmify.
it is but mine shows up as a internet explorer file and when i click on it brings up just another download


[1/5/2026 7:50 PM] zaja0479
can you dm me a picture of what you mean?


[1/5/2026 7:50 PM] zaja0479
the exe should be called ModOrganizer in the install folder


[1/5/2026 7:50 PM] clajmify.
still re installing some stuff but i had an older version of the game and just decided to wipe everything and re download


[1/5/2026 7:51 PM] clajmify.
been having issues ever sense


[1/5/2026 7:52 PM] zaja0479
im also reinstalling from an older version. i ended up wiping wabbajack and the original installation off my pc before starting from scratch. no issues so far besides that enb file


[1/5/2026 7:52 PM] zaja0479
maybe check around the support forum section. use the search function


[1/5/2026 7:52 PM] clajmify.
modding is just a challenge for me still new to it so it’s hard


[1/5/2026 7:53 PM] knowing_goyim

[1/5/2026 7:53 PM] knockups

[1/5/2026 7:59 PM] knowing_goyim
ah i see


[1/5/2026 8:14 PM] clajmify.
It’s because i never actually installed that enb file it never extracted anything through wabbajack and continued the rest

Shimmy like left and right


[1/5/2026 9:03 PM] soarin_skys

And weapons


[1/5/2026 9:05 PM] knowing_goyim

[1/5/2026 9:05 PM] soarin_skys
You can get up to 5 legendary effects on a piece of gear


[1/5/2026 9:05 PM] soarin_skys
Just gets expensive in chips


[1/5/2026 9:05 PM] soarin_skys
Get lots of chips with scrapper maxed


[1/5/2026 9:07 PM] knowing_goyim
ok nice so i max salvage to 100 or max scrapper 3 ranks?


[1/5/2026 9:08 PM] soarin_skys
Both I want to say scrapper effects the amount of scrap you gain


[1/5/2026 9:08 PM] knowing_goyim
thanks you've been very helpful. i will do that.


[1/5/2026 9:08 PM] soarin_skys
I mean I got 100 salvage and scrapper 3 and getting like 3 chips and like a lot of components from weapons


[1/5/2026 9:08 PM] soarin_skys
Like wow


[1/5/2026 9:09 PM] soarin_skys
Sucks adhesive and ballistic fiber are the main components that I need since no weapons or armor give that lol


[1/5/2026 9:10 PM] knowing_goyim
ballistic fiber i've seen a few ammo bags and that's it. and i didn't even know you could get chips from scrap i had a lvl 71 character 2/3 through the game and 5 chips total from finding them in chests.


[1/5/2026 9:11 PM] clajmify.

[1/5/2026 9:25 PM] soarin_skys
Like I checked E activation button


[1/5/2026 9:25 PM] soarin_skys
Which makes the E key as my activate button


[1/5/2026 9:26 PM] soarin_skys

Upgrade to latest version then run wabbajack.

Then enb will fail, use this link for the enb:

https://pastebin.com/0VMhCZUa

dont unpack the zip, just drop it in the downloads folder and run wabba again.


[1/6/2026 6:36 AM] rockitao
lol what's with this Feral ghoul chair in concord? i'm scared to sit, but curious


[1/6/2026 7:45 AM] 14ay6
Is NAC X compatible with this ? Or at least does this modpack have an alternative ? In case I wanna change preset sometimes


[1/6/2026 7:45 AM] tesme
i can't see anything in the game it's daylight and it's crazy dark how can i manage the luminosity brothers ?


[1/6/2026 7:47 AM] 14ay6
Yeah I wanna change the preset. It's unbearably dark at night


[1/6/2026 7:47 AM] 14ay6
But modpack doesn't have NAC X


[1/6/2026 7:47 AM] tesme
apparently when you have a mask on it's so dark


[1/6/2026 7:47 AM] 14ay6
Yeah.


[1/6/2026 7:48 AM] tesme
You have a fix for that ?


[1/6/2026 7:48 AM] jaegerdaddy
yeah just came here to ask about this , sorry for butting in

[1/6/2026 7:48 AM] tesme

[1/6/2026 7:50 AM] jaegerdaddy
is there a way to edit that? I looked in the mcm for the gas mask but found nothing about this ( or im blind)


[1/6/2026 7:51 AM] jaegerdaddy
cuz i wanna get rid of this darkness filter, makes no sense anyway, im fine restricted vision and all but it shouldnt make 9. am. into 7 p.m.


[1/6/2026 7:51 AM] tesme
You're right

[1/6/2026 7:59 AM] jaegerdaddy
lots of people also talk about in the support forum


[1/6/2026 7:59 AM] tesme
Ye i'm reading cant find any solutions tho


[1/6/2026 8:05 AM] kazifca
Go into damn apocalypse, look for the radiation module, and turn off the visual overlay


[1/6/2026 8:05 AM] tesme
@Kazifca mad about something ?

{Reactions}
❤️

[1/6/2026 8:05 AM] kazifca
That basically was enough for my eyes to actually adjust to the game


[1/6/2026 8:05 AM] tesme
I see


[1/6/2026 8:05 AM] tesme
ty for the help


[1/6/2026 8:06 AM] kazifca

[1/6/2026 8:07 AM] kazifca
Turn of the DA overlay

[1/6/2026 8:14 AM] kazifca

[1/6/2026 8:18 AM] tesme
@Kazifcalook your private messages bro


[1/6/2026 8:19 AM] kazifca
I'm gonna explain it in here cause visuals are commonly a question


[1/6/2026 8:19 AM] kazifca
With the game open and loaded into your char, go into mod config menu


[1/6/2026 8:19 AM] kazifca
Gameplay or immersion I think? haven't been on in a couple weeks


[1/6/2026 8:20 AM] kazifca
look for damn apoc


[1/6/2026 8:20 AM] kazifca
radiation module


[1/6/2026 8:20 AM] kazifca
Scroll to the last option, or read idc


[1/6/2026 8:20 AM] tesme
so in game


[1/6/2026 8:20 AM] tesme
alr


[1/6/2026 8:29 AM] kazifca
I found the darkness to be playable after turning off that setting however, with free will at that point you can toss a new ENB in if you still find it too dark


[1/6/2026 8:33 AM] jaegerdaddy
can you guys also answer this in the support forum please?


[1/6/2026 8:34 AM] jaegerdaddy
i am sure many people will ask the same thing about the gasmask brightness


[1/6/2026 8:34 AM] _lxvin
how many active mod by defualt ? 661 ?


[1/6/2026 8:34 AM] jaegerdaddy
and it would be great to have it explained somewhere


[1/6/2026 8:35 AM] jaegerdaddy
i think there are like 2-3 questions about this so if anyone who knows the fix could write a simple answer im sure people (including me) would appreciate that 🙏


[1/6/2026 8:35 AM] jaegerdaddy
yes

[1/6/2026 8:59 AM] ska.08
Why doesn't the gas mask glass overlay fit the screen?


[1/6/2026 8:59 AM] kazifca
Doesn’t fit the screen?


[1/6/2026 8:59 AM] kazifca
Like too small or too big


[1/6/2026 9:00 AM] ska.08
It doesnt extend to the bottom or top of the screen. Its like a rectangle through the middle.


[1/6/2026 9:00 AM] kazifca
Uhhhhhhh, look in damn apocalypse and gas masks of the waste lands in game settings for an aspect ratio setting I think?


[1/6/2026 9:01 AM] kazifca
No guarantee but that kinda sounds aspect ratioey for an overlay


[1/6/2026 9:02 AM] kazifca
There might be an aspect ratio patch in MO2 for it, I’m not sure tbh I can’t really open the game atm lmao


[1/6/2026 9:04 AM] ska.08
does having a higher fov like 120 affect it? Im on 1440p 16x9. Had to disable the actual glass vignette effect cause its a smaller square in the middle of my screen. It is normal sized when ADS'd but the rain effect from imagespace is missing the top/bottom:BlairWitchPulse:


[1/6/2026 9:08 AM] kazifca
No your hz & monitor resolution shouldn’t(SHOULDN’T); But fo4 and the ck engine is weird, In MO2, take a look under optionals if you haven’t and try some items/patches and see if it helps


[1/6/2026 9:08 AM] kazifca
They may have already accounted for this, they are pretty snazzy


[1/6/2026 9:18 AM] ska.08
Yea im unsure how to correct it. It cuts off inside the letterbox for enb.


[1/6/2026 9:19 AM] kazifca
What specs are you running


[1/6/2026 9:20 AM] ska.08
pc?


[1/6/2026 9:21 AM] kazifca
Yea


[1/6/2026 9:23 AM] kazifca
Well actually, after that start by going in game and turning off overlays in MCM until you figure out which one it is, I think DA & gas masks of the wasteland have overlays


[1/6/2026 9:23 AM] ska.08
64GB -5080 -9800X3D  -SAMSUNG 990 EVO -16x9 2560x1440


[1/6/2026 9:24 AM] kazifca
Actual glass my bad, is there a resize option in those settings?


[1/6/2026 9:25 AM] ska.08
not in the mcm. I looked for .ini but those does seem to include them either.


[1/6/2026 9:26 AM] ska.08
disabling rain environmental vfx for MOTW removes it.


[1/6/2026 9:27 AM] ska.08
Might just need to play with mask overlays off


[1/6/2026 9:30 AM] ska.08
Its tied to viewmodel in fov slider.


[1/6/2026 9:31 AM] ska.08
I changed it from 80 to 120 at the beginning before I started playing and that effects the display of the gas mask overlay.


[1/6/2026 9:32 AM] kazifca
Makes sense, now I can stop looking through this bug form


[1/6/2026 9:43 AM] ska.08
110 fov on viewmodel is the limit. No glass overlay with lens overlay is the only way to have the viewmodel higher than 80. Rain effects will not be cut off at 110.


[1/6/2026 10:26 AM] soarin_skys
You could always diable the overlay


[1/6/2026 10:26 AM] soarin_skys
I do that


[1/6/2026 10:26 AM] soarin_skys
I dont like the gas mask visuals


[1/6/2026 10:26 AM] soarin_skys
I keep the blood and dirt though

back it up while downloaded.


[1/6/2026 1:19 PM] vividextent
just in case


[1/6/2026 1:21 PM] knowing_goyim
I have all the dls archived off on a  portable and i wont update unless theres a new team. Still theres a few visual bugs and balancing issues i was hoping someone would address on takeover. Its still better than any other list and even the weird resident evil stuff kinda works with the bleak enb and hardcore systems


[1/6/2026 1:22 PM] knowing_goyim
Like i was considering doing a separate install of Loreout bc biggie is pretty good at skyrim, but i feel like its not hardcore enough


[1/6/2026 1:25 PM] vividextent
and if you owned the original Stalker games the gave the owners the enhance versions free., and the can still be modded to Anomaly, Gamma and a new one Anomaly Custom


[1/6/2026 1:29 PM] moudy9547
hello, how do i tweak graphics, vsync, resolution in game?


[1/6/2026 1:29 PM] moudy9547
im so lost, there is no option for that and the mods are too many, idont wanna broke the game


[1/6/2026 1:32 PM] vividextent
Bethesda doesnt do in game graphics and res what you have to do is change from the fo4 splash screen that has the options menu


[1/6/2026 1:33 PM] vividextent
so you would have to exit the game to access the options menu


[1/6/2026 1:37 PM] moudy9547
so the one that u got lunch tru steam?

Can i make it a hint more subtle? like remove the {{{ parts, perhaps use icons or just you know.. make it subtle?

If you wanted to increase build limit, you could just walk over to the workshop and press space, which will give you a popup, and the first option will allow you to increase limits by 25/50/100%

Is there a way to tweak dmg manually? I get one-shot by raiders and I need at least 6 bullets in head & chest before they die. And the grenades are insane, they go through walls for some reason


[1/7/2026 7:55 AM] peanuts1582
Clearing out Lexington Plant took like 20 deaths since the nades detonate all propane tanks throughout the factory between walls.

Look through your mod config in game, and look for true damage

if that doesn’t work go to support there is a support made for it already and people are getting a certain file from there to work, it makes very little sense

the damage seems fine on everything else... the handguns do around 20-30 damage. ive also played 2 separate characters and the damages were consisent between both playthroughs with the shoulder mounted m2 doing 900+ dmg. do you know what would glitch to cause the dmg to be so high for just the shoulder mounted m2?


[1/8/2026 11:54 PM] soarin_skys
Oh unsure


[1/8/2026 11:55 PM] d3molition001

You might need to find someone to train you. Maybe it's tied to BOS allegiance?

My guess is either finding and completing Danse's quests, or maybe doing the distress signal quest and getting to the lone paladin.

Aight. I'm working on an update today. And I will look at the enb stuff again. NGL getting tired of the issue. And I dont know what causes it still.


[1/10/2026 6:27 AM] _viktor1337
nvm i fixed my issue, 75% kb i just rebound numpad 4 to f1 for time being


[1/10/2026 6:27 AM] streikeizer
Aswell as load order. Some new stuff in terms of the looks department and some updated mods.


[1/10/2026 6:39 AM] lv1metapod
I'm so glad this project is still going after all this time. I haven't been here in like a year but I've been so excited to dive back in.

Anomaly is quite literally the only reason I've ever given Nexus Mods money for premium 😂


[1/10/2026 6:41 AM] streikeizer
Money well spend my man🫡


[1/10/2026 6:41 AM] lv1metapod
They should have like curator codes or something. "Are you subscribing for a specific developer/reason? They'll get a portion of the subscription fee."


[1/10/2026 6:42 AM] streikeizer
Some of the new stuff for the upcoming update. 
At least if I get it to work on Anomaly proper.

Is it normal for adjusting the butt slider to make the arms and shoulder blades all jagged and weird? 😂  Or should I just not try to edit presets


[1/10/2026 6:43 AM] streikeizer
whahah no clue


[1/10/2026 6:44 AM] streikeizer
I always forget CBBE and such ngl


[1/10/2026 6:44 AM] kazifca
Ayo, with enhanced movement & Actor velocity framework, did you notice the crashes when sliding into like, pebbles


[1/10/2026 6:44 AM] kazifca
Sorry to interject, my ass is tryina figure that out


[1/10/2026 6:44 AM] streikeizer
Yessir


[1/10/2026 6:44 AM] streikeizer
Its one of the drawbacks of that mod.


[1/10/2026 6:44 AM] kazifca
Do you know what causes that?


[1/10/2026 6:45 AM] kazifca
engine level?


[1/10/2026 6:45 AM] streikeizer
yeah


[1/10/2026 6:45 AM] kazifca
Man


[1/10/2026 6:45 AM] streikeizer
Not alot to do about that one sadly.


[1/10/2026 6:45 AM] kazifca
It feels like a error handling issue


[1/10/2026 6:45 AM] kazifca
If it's an engine limitation


[1/10/2026 6:46 AM] streikeizer
Yeah I think so aswell.


[1/10/2026 6:46 AM] kazifca
if only python was fast enough


[1/10/2026 6:46 AM] streikeizer
I hoped for the Skyrim SE treatment of Fallout 4. But that never happend and we got the shit we have now👌


[1/10/2026 6:47 AM] kazifca
Then I'd do it myself


[1/10/2026 6:48 AM] kazifca

I'll also report it to the guy, idk if he knows but his bug page is pretty small


[1/10/2026 6:50 AM] kazifca
very solid two mods beyond that miniscule detail


[1/10/2026 6:51 AM] streikeizer
Should do. Keep in mind that Anomaly uses a shit ton of stuff to do what it does. And there could be a mod beside the enhanced movement one. That causes the issue.


[1/10/2026 6:51 AM] kazifca
Nono


[1/10/2026 6:51 AM] kazifca
I can replicate it easily


[1/10/2026 6:51 AM] kazifca

[1/10/2026 6:51 AM] streikeizer

[1/10/2026 6:51 AM] kazifca

[1/10/2026 6:59 AM] f1sual
hi ive been having trouble getting the ENB to install ive gone through the website trouble shooting and downloaded it and added the file to the downloads file but still wont work


[1/10/2026 7:01 AM] kazifca
Try adding, two copies of the enb into the download folder, restart wabbajack and re run the install (if you haven't)


[1/10/2026 7:06 AM] f1sual
ive just done that and still the same issue. it just said Download Failed


[1/10/2026 7:06 AM] f1sual
Would a complete re install of the hole thig help ?


[1/10/2026 7:07 AM] streikeizer
I would wait a couple of hours. I'm working on an update atm. That I will drop soon with hopefully a fix.


[1/10/2026 7:08 AM] streikeizer
Note could be buggier thanks to addition of more stuff.


[1/10/2026 7:08 AM] kazifca
How does wabbajack search for a filename? do you guys put in a list or is it automatic


[1/10/2026 7:08 AM] streikeizer
Nah I think there are 2 enb files in there. and some fucked meta download links


[1/10/2026 7:09 AM] streikeizer
But I havent looked into anything since the last drop in annoucement. Only got time again today.


[1/10/2026 7:11 AM] kazifca

Oooh okay, and is there a way to fix this ?


[1/10/2026 7:26 AM] streikeizer
Go into MCM and adjust values under Combat True Dmg.


[1/10/2026 7:26 AM] streikeizer
There isnt a good setup yet that fits all players. So try to fiddle around with it a bit to see if you can find something to your liking.

Why is VATS not working? (using Q key - default) - I'm playing on very hard and not survival, thanks


[1/10/2026 8:08 AM] boomcha_10185
no vats in this mod. slow time instead


[1/10/2026 8:24 AM] npcstalin
It's a Bullet time mod instead that replaces vats. Keybind "G"


[1/10/2026 8:28 AM] alphaandomega_74989
AH! I looked under controls and didn't see it - G it is then thanks 🙂


[1/10/2026 8:29 AM] alphaandomega_74989
One other question - when I put a gasmask on it's super saturated and dark - is this intentional? (rest of the colours with mask off are fine)


[1/10/2026 8:31 AM] alphaandomega_74989
Hmm  G is not working either


[1/10/2026 8:32 AM] npcstalin
Go into your mcm settings, then search for damn apocalypse, somewhere in there it should be an option called visual overlay - toggle off that option. And you should be good 🙂


[1/10/2026 8:34 AM] npcstalin
Hmm, maybe I remember it wrong then - my bad. Almost certain it's G, and you need to press and hold, it's not a toggle.


[1/10/2026 8:40 AM] alphaandomega_74989
Bindings menu musn't be working - remapped to a different key and held it and no luck 🙁


[1/10/2026 8:41 AM] alphaandomega_74989
But damn apocalypse effect is sorted thanks for that

So d'you figure the project StreikEizer mentioned is just "What if we make our own fallout/stalker game, with blackjack and hookers"?


[1/10/2026 8:43 AM] kazifca
maybe, I imagine easier maintenance is a big one


[1/10/2026 8:43 AM] streikeizer
Lets say Anomaly is getting some major changes in the upcoming months.


[1/10/2026 8:44 AM] streikeizer
Oh and no more 0.6, 0.7 etc. This project is getting finished.


[1/10/2026 8:44 AM] knifewizzerd
Hell Yeah


[1/10/2026 8:44 AM] con6494
I need to ask- would this latest update require a full restart?


[1/10/2026 8:44 AM] streikeizer
I would reccomend it.


[1/10/2026 8:44 AM] streikeizer
Its not needed since this stuff needs 72 hours ingame to reset.


[1/10/2026 8:46 AM] con6494
Alright. As much as I'd love to, I probably won't- I'm at a middle ground where I really don't want to start over despite still feeling really early game


[1/10/2026 8:47 AM] con6494
I *just* started to feel comfortable in a fight lol


[1/10/2026 8:48 AM] streikeizer
Fair enough. the upcoming update will be 100% not save safe.


[1/10/2026 8:49 AM] tyleezey
So is anomaly not able to install due to enb not working properly rn?


[1/10/2026 8:49 AM] con6494
No, you can do it


[1/10/2026 8:49 AM] con6494
You just need to do something weird with a link, and it should work


[1/10/2026 8:49 AM] tyleezey
bc im currently trying to download anomaly and I am getting the enbseries unable to download error, i followed the troubleshoot


[1/10/2026 8:50 AM] tyleezey
something weird with the link?


[1/10/2026 8:50 AM] con6494
^ This


[1/10/2026 8:51 AM] con6494
I think I misunderstood. What you're putting out officially on Wabbajack isn't save safe, but the link you posted in the announcement *is*, right?


[1/10/2026 8:52 AM] tyleezey
thanks, i got it to work


[1/10/2026 8:53 AM] kazifca

naw not that I know of


[1/10/2026 10:04 AM] kazifca
go for er, might have issues with the enb


[1/10/2026 10:10 AM] npcstalin
I know that panpc sadly isn't part of the pack due mostly to the author of the mod. However.. If I would dl the mod and add it manually myself, roughly where should I place it in my loadorder?


[1/10/2026 10:21 AM] darklary
Is fire SUPPOSED to kill me instantly?

[1/10/2026 11:28 AM] darklary
if you mouse over it and hit the keybind labeled in the bottom middle it brings up the menu. Unless that isn't working?


[1/10/2026 11:35 AM] npcstalin
another odd lil question - i see that we got the picturesque presets for Looksmenu, howcome the presets arn't showing up in a tab in looksmenu? or is that on my end?


[1/10/2026 11:43 AM] perinthia
I for some reason felt the modlist wasn't hard enough for what i wanted and decided to add a couple mods to make things a bit more difficult, i think i may have flown too close too the sun

[1/10/2026 12:33 PM] va1haze
has anyone else encountered a thing that if you go to an interior, die there by enemies. Then you load the game and go to the same interior and eveyone is missing. Even some doors gets deleted. And yes. The mod pack has been installed correctly.


[1/10/2026 12:41 PM] perinthia
even when using your flashlight? ik dark areas are meant to be incredibly dark and force you to use a light


[1/10/2026 12:49 PM] yeviltkira
in the overworld at day time :/


[1/10/2026 12:50 PM] yeviltkira
i do think its bugged honestly (it wasnt like this in an older version i played thats why i assume it to be bugged)


[1/10/2026 12:54 PM] rockitao
whatever it was done with the ENB with this last update that was released today made the game look a lot better


[1/10/2026 1:34 PM] perinthia
that sounds like its may be bugged for you, because its very bright for me during the day


[1/10/2026 1:35 PM] perinthia
also just checking for when fighting power armor enemies, you have to destroy the armor before being able to actually hurt them right?


[1/10/2026 1:41 PM] perinthia

I'm loving this modpack, but I can't figure out how to get rid of all inventory cluttering items. I was able to remove some like Power Armor HUD Switcher item either in the MCM or by using the item to find the setting to remove them.
Every time I place the following items in a container a new one gets added to my inventory: 
AFT Readme
AFT Master Control
Gas Mask Repair Kit Menu

And there are two items I want to get rid of but can't move:
(Cheat Terminal Portable)
Settings (This is for the See Through Scopes mod)

I use hotkeys for everything so I don't need these items, and I certainly don't need the AFT Readme, anyone know how to remove these items permanently without them getting re-added? I would greatly appreciate it!


[1/10/2026 9:05 PM] fallenstar39
Is there a rough ETA on when the update mentioned this morning might go out? I was just about to start a new character, and am wondering if I should wait a little bit before giving it a go?


[1/10/2026 9:45 PM] woodtierbum
Does the inquesitor  cowl count?


[1/10/2026 9:53 PM] perinthia
Im currently level 41 and i have yet to encounter 1 enemy with the Thermal or Night vision goggles and its quite annoying since they are so useful lol


[1/10/2026 10:02 PM] perinthia
also does anyone know what may be causing enemies lights to just not show up randomly? these 2 pictures are taken from the same spot, seconds apart

[1/10/2026 10:05 PM] zaja0479
I think he uploaded the wabbajack file to a Google drive until further notice. For stability reasons. I saw it earlier but I can link it in a sec if thats the one youre looking for


[1/10/2026 10:06 PM] fallenstar39
Actually yeah, that would be great!


[1/10/2026 10:09 PM] fallenstar39

[1/10/2026 10:48 PM] obiwankenoia

You can add it to the mask database


[1/10/2026 11:54 PM] soarin_skys
Just be warned


[1/10/2026 11:55 PM] soarin_skys
I found that the database works only 1 time after that any mask you try to add wont add


[1/10/2026 11:55 PM] soarin_skys

Hello! coming over from the loreout modlist to see if this is a bit harder, im big on weapons and settlements, does that kinda match the jive here?


[1/11/2026 3:51 AM] killinitspeed
Hey I have been trying to install this for so long, I have everything except for enb installed the enbseries fallout4 v0501.zip, it says finished downloading 5.6kb/out of 3.1mb then it says that it was unable to download it and cannot continue, was unable to download one or more archives. I looked on the read me and downloaded it directly and reseted but wabbajack just deletes it when I restart the installation and back to square one


[1/11/2026 3:51 AM] killinitspeed
Pls help


[1/11/2026 4:10 AM] npcstalin
im probably just an idiot but... What do i do with that googledrive file i got from the announcement?!


[1/11/2026 4:11 AM] npcstalin

[1/11/2026 4:29 AM] kazifca
yes, but probably in a different way then what you're expecting for the first while. Unless you're used to the difficulty, then go ballz to the walls


[1/11/2026 4:30 AM] fhantomburgerandfries
im familiar with GAMMA for stalker itself, just never played a decently hardcore list for fallout.


[1/11/2026 4:31 AM] kazifca
There's a couple, anomaly is a little more focused on the specific thing they wanted to do, you NEED to settlement build to some degree unless you're an animal at combat and scavenging


[1/11/2026 4:32 AM] fhantomburgerandfries
huge, thats what im looking for instead of a convenient place to throw all the junk i've collected. the more im encouraged to actually have a "base" the happier i am.


[1/11/2026 4:34 AM] kazifca
As long as that base doesn't mean base list to build off, go hog wild lmao.
always dangerous altering large lists, you will have difficulties converting it into say, a frost list


[1/11/2026 4:36 AM] glessalebz3000
Who know how to off background blur effect when you watching on object and everything on blur that is not in eye focus?


[1/11/2026 4:38 AM] fhantomburgerandfries
ah yeah nah, even with Loreout I don't mess with anything outside of the "ordained" settings and mods. if something i want gets added, cool, if not, oh well.


[1/11/2026 4:40 AM] kazifca
Stick away from overhauls (generally) and you'll be in the clear, always exclusions & always read documentation when available!


[1/11/2026 4:41 AM] kazifca
Depth of field effect?


[1/11/2026 4:41 AM] fhantomburgerandfries
If i add one mod i'll add a hundred, and my level of knowledge when it comes to troubleshooting and working with the technical aspects of mods is abysmal. appreciate the advise though


[1/11/2026 4:42 AM] kazifca
Armour and weapons are always pretty safe, if you want to integrate them better look at the robco patcher mod page and look at the articles and read through


[1/11/2026 4:43 AM] eldritchwat
what would happen if i reinstalled and downgraded fallout 4? leaving the stock game folder within the modlist's folder untouched


[1/11/2026 4:43 AM] fhantomburgerandfries
hm, i might have to do that then, i always feel like the heavy weapons, launchers specifically, get left out


[1/11/2026 4:45 AM] glessalebz3000
maybe that's what it's called. Unfortunately i can't pin a screenshot


[1/11/2026 4:45 AM] kazifca
Look for the effect through the menus, and try it


[1/11/2026 4:46 AM] kazifca
I am new to modding and editing the game I can't identify issue by just looking at them


[1/11/2026 4:46 AM] kazifca
not at my audio engineer levels, yet


[1/11/2026 4:46 AM] kazifca
LMGs


[1/11/2026 4:46 AM] kazifca
❤️


[1/11/2026 4:47 AM] fhantomburgerandfries
Ah man yeah, I don’t know what mod it is in Loreout but something adds the NV Light Machine Gun in 5.56, love the M249 vibes


[1/11/2026 4:47 AM] kazifca
Game is way harder with more LMGs


[1/11/2026 4:47 AM] kazifca
Far more dangerous


[1/11/2026 4:48 AM] fhantomburgerandfries
That’s sort of my complaint about power armor, save for the occasional gunner or raider boss with a fat man, they don’t really have any way of dealing with you


[1/11/2026 4:49 AM] kazifca
That's more of a damage values vs health balancing issue, once you fix that, 6-7 relatively smart AI's with a couple LMGs & pistols can tear you up


[1/11/2026 4:50 AM] fhantomburgerandfries
I always thought of them being more organized and having a “makeshift” anti material rifle or something would be nice


[1/11/2026 4:50 AM] kazifca
Already in there iirc


[1/11/2026 4:51 AM] kazifca
or the Rat Runners Anti Mat is free to download on nexus


[1/11/2026 4:51 AM] fhantomburgerandfries
General question, I noticed you start with basically no special stats, is there a “learn by doing” system or are you kinda just forced put level up points into your special stats


[1/11/2026 4:51 AM] kazifca

[1/11/2026 4:51 AM] kazifca

[1/11/2026 4:53 AM] fhantomburgerandfries
Fair enough, I’ll trial and error my way through and see how it feels


[1/11/2026 4:53 AM] kazifca
You might also restart a few times, just do it


[1/11/2026 4:53 AM] kazifca
its ok


[1/11/2026 4:56 AM] kazifca
This would be better suited in a more general modding specific discord, I wish I could answer this question but I've not a damn clue my guy, there a mod that does what your looking for tho without the need for downloading and reinstalling


[1/11/2026 4:56 AM] kazifca
I forget what its called you'll have to look around


[1/11/2026 4:59 AM] fhantomburgerandfries
Pretty sure nexus has a discord


[1/11/2026 5:00 AM] kazifca
I would send them over to modding collective


[1/11/2026 5:00 AM] kazifca
I have no clue where I joined that server from atm tho


[1/11/2026 5:02 AM] fhantomburgerandfries
Pretty sure you can get an invite link from the server itself


[1/11/2026 5:03 AM] kazifca
Ally, am I allowed to link their discord


[1/11/2026 5:05 AM] fhantomburgerandfries
Is there a FAQ so I’m not inundating you with questions


[1/11/2026 5:06 AM] kazifca
Not in the way you're looking for, its best to look through the MCM and search up mods and see what they do to get a general idea


[1/11/2026 5:07 AM] kazifca
a fair amount has been changed and altered to be compatible and work together


[1/11/2026 5:07 AM] fhantomburgerandfries
Ah yeah I was looking for all the specifics that this mod pack does, interact as F, no vats button, etc.


[1/11/2026 5:08 AM] kazifca
Look through the MCM, search up mods, all controls can be remapped if you're committed to your cause


[1/11/2026 5:08 AM] kazifca
plus, introduces you to tons of mods


[1/11/2026 5:08 AM] kazifca
So if you ever want to build your own list, you have refrence on places to start

[1/11/2026 5:09 AM] kazifca

[1/11/2026 5:21 AM] fhantomburgerandfries
Last question, I read through the MCM and found all the relevant keyholes


[1/11/2026 5:21 AM] fhantomburgerandfries
Keybinds*


[1/11/2026 5:21 AM] fhantomburgerandfries
What does the survival pack do? It gave a message saying I unpacked to gather my thoughts, but the item disappeared and nothing happened


[1/11/2026 5:24 AM] kazifca
it saves your game


[1/11/2026 5:25 AM] kazifca
Actual save, not a quick save or exit save

[1/11/2026 5:57 AM] kazifca
What version of the game are you on?


[1/11/2026 6:00 AM] vividextent
give me a sec cause I can play genesis but i dont know the version. version 1.10


[1/11/2026 6:01 AM] kazifca
Yea, update if you wanna play anomaly


[1/11/2026 6:01 AM] kazifca
I still have no clue what the name of this is but you may, also want to look into it


[1/11/2026 6:02 AM] vividextent
so Upgrade to 1.11?


[1/11/2026 6:03 AM] kazifca
Yea, I'm pretty sure the most recent update was made compatible


[1/11/2026 6:03 AM] vividextent
when I installed it last time I had to downgrade?


[1/11/2026 6:03 AM] kazifca
so it's looking for the newest version of cc content


[1/11/2026 6:03 AM] kazifca
Me to brother


[1/11/2026 6:03 AM] kazifca
the update is pretty recent though


[1/11/2026 6:04 AM] vividextent
shit thats goin my windows drive then.


[1/11/2026 6:04 AM] vividextent
but I have cc content here look


[1/11/2026 6:05 AM] kazifca
Yea, the version is more so the issue I would imagine


[1/11/2026 6:06 AM] fhantomburgerandfries
Oh you handmade havoc is gone, you can’t craft ammo?


[1/11/2026 6:07 AM] kazifca
Are you on immersive crafting


[1/11/2026 6:07 AM] fhantomburgerandfries
Whatever the default settings are, haven’t changed a thing


[1/11/2026 6:07 AM] kazifca
I think, heavy liability, that its immersive to begin with


[1/11/2026 6:07 AM] kazifca
gotta find an engineering bench and overdue books


[1/11/2026 6:08 AM] fhantomburgerandfries
Oh.. that’s what those are for. I left them because I never use overdue books in regular play throughs. Cheers again.


[1/11/2026 6:57 AM] streikeizer
Yeah. I'm somewhat still testing it myself. If all goes well in my own testing. it can go up aswell.


[1/11/2026 7:00 AM] streikeizer
all new stuff has been transferred over from the other project me and ally are working on. And the updated series also mixes in between factions. So I hope I hit a 75% base game coverage already with outfits.


[1/11/2026 7:01 AM] streikeizer
Also the gasmasks stuff. that hopefully doesnt break more than I think.

If I get all the files in could I just manually unzip all of them? I can get literally all of them except enbseries and whenever I manually download it wabbajack removes it

[1/11/2026 1:42 PM] .ggeasy
Hello, my problem is apparently related to the ENB Series, I already downloaded it manually and placed it in the installation folder but when I try to finish it through Wabbajack the error persists and the file disappears from the folder where I had placed it previously, I don't know what to do after that.


[1/11/2026 1:43 PM] zaja0479

[1/11/2026 1:48 PM] .ggeasy
Even following your tip didn't work, maybe I need to do some kind of downgrade?


[1/11/2026 2:03 PM] zaja0479
I just redownloaded the ENB file and repasted into my mod download folder. The installation started without an issue. Make sure that your downloads folder is empty. Once you open the pastebin link, a wabbajack link will be there. Copy and paste that in your browser and it should download the correct version of ENB. Then move that into the folder holding all your mods.


[1/11/2026 2:08 PM] .ggeasy
That's exactly what I've been trying to do for hours. the conclusion is that after pasting the zip file into the folder and returning to Wabbajack to finish the installation the error still persists, when I go to the folder to check the file it is no longer there, it magically disappeared and therefore it is impossible to finish.


[1/11/2026 2:08 PM] npcstalin
no downgrade or anything like that is needed.

Just make sure to put the (untouched) downloaded zipfile into the downloads folder, make sure that wabbajack is closed down before doing it. Then just start it up once the file is there and (*in the words of Todd Howard*) **it just works**.


[1/11/2026 2:11 PM] .ggeasy
I just tried this, I was unsuccessful.


[1/11/2026 2:12 PM] npcstalin

Sorry frnd, then i'm honestly clueless in what to do. has worked for everyone 'til now :/

[1/11/2026 2:19 PM] npcstalin
wrong type of cigarette pack then Sir ❤️  two different types of packs.


[1/11/2026 2:26 PM] zaja0479
When this was happening to me I wasn't pasting the correct version (the one from the pastebin link) in the folder, and instead I kept accidentally pasting the one that I had downloaded prior (from the ENB website). I'm sorry that I can't help you man. I hope you figure it out soon.


[1/11/2026 2:29 PM] .ggeasy
i'm trying a new installation, thank you for trying to help me with my problem, I wish you good luck on the way.


[1/11/2026 2:38 PM] perinthia

Wabbajack is deleting the enb, is there any way to fix this


[1/11/2026 3:20 PM] perinthia
This is a common issue, i belive its been covered a few times on the support forum


[1/11/2026 3:22 PM] ned4903
Does anyone know where to find the "switch chem" or "hotkey"  so i can use and toggle the night vision options for power armor?

where do i get plates if enemies arent dropping any? game is unplayable without them


[1/11/2026 4:15 PM] ned4903
|| Armor Crafting Bench ||


[1/11/2026 4:15 PM] ned4903
gotta learn how to craft that first tho


[1/11/2026 4:15 PM] kazifca
Somewhere, theres also a tool to craft junk plates on the fly


[1/11/2026 4:22 PM] .ggeasy
do i need to download any extra DLC for the modlist to be installed?


[1/11/2026 4:24 PM] kazifca
you need all the dlc as far as I know


[1/11/2026 4:27 PM] kazifca
Maybe not tbh


[1/11/2026 4:27 PM] kazifca
This shouldn't be required


[1/11/2026 4:27 PM] kazifca
What version are you on


[1/11/2026 4:33 PM] .ggeasy
wait a moment, apparently I managed to solve my persistent installation error problem


[1/11/2026 4:33 PM] .ggeasy
i changed the game's language on Steam after rewatching the YouTube video for the thousandth time and realizing this, I set it to English but I'm BRAZILIAN. At least my installation progressed and now the files are being extracted, but I don't know how I'm going to be able to play in a language other than my own


[1/11/2026 4:34 PM] kazifca
you'll probably have to go online and look for mods that have been translated brother


[1/11/2026 4:36 PM] .ggeasy
okay that's a problem, more things to worry about


[1/11/2026 4:36 PM] .ggeasy
maybe i'll just give up and come back later, i've really spent too many hours here


[1/11/2026 4:42 PM] kazifca

Stupid question but how do you start the game and get out of your pod because I can’t scroll my mouse down to hit enter anomaly


[1/11/2026 5:25 PM] killinitspeed
Pressing enter doesn’t work as well


[1/11/2026 7:08 PM] mr.shaft_
does anybody know how to turn depth of field off this shit sucks


[1/11/2026 7:08 PM] mr.shaft_
I changed my resolution smaller so the edge of the screen would show


[1/11/2026 7:25 PM] mez_96
Anyobody have mods that dont install and when you add them and retry Wabbajack it just deletes them froem the download folder?


[1/11/2026 7:25 PM] kazifca
Are you talking about the enb or are you trying to add to the list mid process


[1/11/2026 7:26 PM] mez_96
yeah its the enbseries v0501

how does one do that I looked on the mod organizer and I can't find it, lol


[1/11/2026 7:30 PM] kazifca
Open your game profile folder on MO2, close MO2, look for bethini, open bethini


[1/11/2026 7:30 PM] kazifca
just make sure you save


[1/11/2026 7:32 PM] bootineye
Curious about the modpack being updated? How do I update it exactly? When the new one is up do I delete the old one myself and download the one or how does it work?


[1/11/2026 7:32 PM] kazifca
That one is to be answered by Ally or the great cow farmer


[1/11/2026 7:33 PM] fhantomburgerandfries
Looking for suggestions, the scaverwith the APC key despawned, any ideas?


[1/11/2026 7:34 PM] kazifca
Despawned?


[1/11/2026 7:34 PM] kazifca
Like, you killed him and his body went poof


[1/11/2026 7:37 PM] fhantomburgerandfries
More like I didn’t have time to loot him initially because of all the ghouls, by the time I went back he was gone

Where do you get a 'Crafting Journal'?  I need it to make a ammo bench


[1/11/2026 8:33 PM] kazifca

i just updated my fallout 4 to the latest version, do i have to downgrade to play this?


[1/11/2026 8:48 PM] kazifca
No


[1/11/2026 8:56 PM] perinthia
man that 50 cal shoulder mounted cannon is disgusting when enemies have it, trying to get through a room with a bunch of super mutants and 2-3 of them have that thing, and it will 1 shot you even in the strongest power armor


[1/11/2026 9:04 PM] mr.shaft_
look in the tools folder for the ini adjuster called bethini. change resolution in there. close MO before you change it


[1/11/2026 10:33 PM] izzaacbruh
Is there any suggestions to decrease difficulty? Especially while starting out having to have a gas mask on 24/7 and by the time you get to Preston Garvey suffering from every form of poisoning with no opportunity to save and sleep. Really just looking for tips something that reduce the radiation and healing system the rest is fine


[1/11/2026 10:56 PM] butcherofblaviken8
In the Gasmask MCM make the filters last longer and change the weather setting to one of the other options like radiation weather only


[1/11/2026 11:04 PM] killinitspeed
hey sorry to bother you but when I look at the ini editor I see 3 categories with a bunch of options where is bethini?


[1/11/2026 11:06 PM] fhantomburgerandfries
Anyone know if the ghillie armor actually improves stealth?


[1/11/2026 11:12 PM] izzaacbruh
Changed this and a few other small stuff thank you 👍


[1/11/2026 11:14 PM] butcherofblaviken8
No problem those are the options i use to make the radiation less rough

Aw man, I didn’t know the storyteller was in this. Now I’m sad

is it safe to remove damn apocalypse from the modlist? its pretty fundamentally broken in regards to the dlc with just standing near automatron corpses giving upwards of 100 IRA per second


[1/11/2026 11:46 PM] sugondese1423
Hey how do I lean do I have to add a mod or does one come installed w the mod pack


[1/12/2026 12:15 AM] yami_ger
No since lots of mods are damm patched in there and all


[1/12/2026 12:15 AM] yami_ger
There is under optional one only enable it after leaving the vault


[1/12/2026 12:18 AM] soulless3059
Hey all, can anyone help me figure out how to get Wabbajack to recognize the manually downloaded ENB 0.501?


[1/12/2026 12:46 AM] sugondese1423
So I’m a few hours into the game do I need to restart or is it something I can adjust in the MCM

is the x-01 quantum just a trash armor prop in this modlist?


[1/12/2026 1:20 AM] snuggles02x
hey just wondering. The new update for the weapons and armor, does it rework the levelling system of those weapons and armors?


[1/12/2026 1:21 AM] snuggles02x
or does it just add and remove cerian ones?


[1/12/2026 1:21 AM] snuggles02x

[1/12/2026 4:28 AM] yami_ger
look in mo2 there shoudl be a mod called educated shooter


[1/12/2026 4:32 AM] streikeizer
Oh yeah gotta remove that one still😅


[1/12/2026 4:36 AM] streikeizer
For  now it adds and distributes some more outfits to npcs. These have  not been balanced. They will be looked over if they are too broken. Aswell as some other older stuff will be looked over aswell.


[1/12/2026 4:38 AM] streikeizer
I have tested yesterday and the build seemed to work as inteneded. Gotta run the complex sorter after work and its ready for wabbajack. Sadly this one is not 100% save safe.


[1/12/2026 6:12 AM] rockitao
is it safe for me to remove these unscrappable cars in settlements through console? I feel these cars are going to explode eventually, killing settlers and destroying defenses

[1/12/2026 8:22 AM] obiwankenoia
setting it to fullscreen instead of border less window fixed it, but isn’t there a way of making it work in border less?

Hello people. I made a chat post yesterday about the radiation system difficulty but still having trouble. Is there any  way to almost completely turn it off? I am loving everything about the modlist aesthetic wise, gunplay exploration loot pools and the survival, but the radiation system turns the survival features into a chore rather than a fun challenge. Any ways to limit it? I guess its counter intuitive to play a hardcore modlist and want it easier but the rest of the mods in this pack are exactly what I’m looking for


[1/12/2026 3:50 PM] thirtyfour17
did anyone else have trouble downloading the main files i only get a downloads folder everthing else fails


[1/12/2026 4:12 PM] .ggeasy

Look in the Damn Apocalypse's radiation module and turn off the overlay


[1/12/2026 5:14 PM] kazifca
right at the bottom when you make it to the module in the MCM


[1/12/2026 5:15 PM] bogansloth
when i try loading mcm my game freezes up


[1/12/2026 5:15 PM] kazifca
Let it cache


[1/12/2026 5:15 PM] bogansloth
so its normal to freeze up the mouse etc?


[1/12/2026 5:15 PM] kazifca
Its loading like


[1/12/2026 5:15 PM] kazifca
6-8k settings


[1/12/2026 5:16 PM] kazifca
let it cache it'll just take a second


[1/12/2026 5:16 PM] bogansloth
ez as


[1/12/2026 5:16 PM] kazifca
it'll get faster after it's done it successfully


[1/12/2026 5:16 PM] bogansloth
everything else has been good but i literally cant see the red rocket its that dark xD


[1/12/2026 5:17 PM] kazifca
I mean turning off the overlay won't turn off how dark it is


[1/12/2026 5:17 PM] kazifca
it'll make 3ft in front of you visable though


[1/12/2026 5:17 PM] bogansloth
it was so bad i literally couldnt see 2 bloodsuckers on a bramin or a zombie 2ft from me in concord


[1/12/2026 5:18 PM] kazifca
Yep the DA overlay is a lil brutal


[1/12/2026 5:18 PM] bogansloth
Yeh i needed the torch in vault 111


[1/12/2026 5:20 PM] bogansloth
so just damn apocalypse visual overlays?


[1/12/2026 5:20 PM] kazifca
Yeah, I generally leave the gas mask overlay on


[1/12/2026 5:23 PM] bogansloth
still seems the same mustve hit the wrong setting


[1/12/2026 5:23 PM] thirtyfour17
do i need to downgrade?


[1/12/2026 5:23 PM] kazifca
no


[1/12/2026 5:24 PM] thirtyfour17

[1/12/2026 5:24 PM] kazifca
MCM, Damn Apoc, radiation module right at the bottom very last option


[1/12/2026 5:24 PM] kazifca
off


[1/12/2026 5:26 PM] kazifca
if thats still too dark for you, unless there's a weird config file kicking around for you, Eizer might be more informed than me on that, you can go into MO2 and reinstall darker nights


[1/12/2026 5:28 PM] bogansloth
is it in the settings manager section or the dont touch me section


[1/12/2026 5:28 PM] kazifca
no


[1/12/2026 5:28 PM] kazifca
its in gameplay or immersion


[1/12/2026 5:28 PM] bogansloth
oh im in the damn apoc settings XD


[1/12/2026 5:29 PM] kazifca
It's got subsections


[1/12/2026 5:29 PM] bogansloth
ahhh


[1/12/2026 5:29 PM] bogansloth
ill figure that out but holy shit i can see what the suns shining on


[1/12/2026 5:29 PM] kazifca
Yea, that specific overlay is like

For science rank 2 is that just leveling it up with skill points or a perk you have to take


[1/12/2026 5:30 PM] kazifca
Invest skill points

I'm kinda surprised that the Boston Riot Helmets don't count as gas masks for the purpose of GoTC. I'm pretty sure they were outfitted with air scrubbers and armor locks for that exact thing, weren't they?


[1/12/2026 6:35 PM] yozard
hi


[1/12/2026 6:37 PM] kazifca
Different mod authors, you can manually add the helmet though that'll come with the occasional bugginess


[1/12/2026 6:39 PM] con6494
Oh, well, yeah! I mean, I figured that. I wonder how buggy it would actually be.


[1/12/2026 6:39 PM] kazifca

This a prototype ^


[1/12/2026 7:55 PM] darthsawyer
There are some calibers missing from this list, where can we find the rest? 
Missing: 
.22
.223
.25
.30-06
.300 AAC Blackout
.300 BLK
.303
.32
.40
.410 Gauge (I assume 20 Gauge is Standard, 12 Gauge is Combat, does this do the same 1200 as those?)
.44-40 (I assume the normal .44 is the .44 magnum on this list)
.458 SOCOM
300 Magnum
4.6x30mm
6.5mm
7.62mm Rimmed (This might be the (Handmade) in the list? Or is the regular 7.62mm the (Handmade)?)
9mm Soviet
9x39mm SP-5
FN 5.7x28mm
Institute EM Cartridge
25mm Grenade
40mm Grenade
Electron Charge pack
Rocket
Missile
Plasma Cell
I have a general idea of how much damage these would do based on IRL use, like .22 probably does barely any damage, but a bunch of these I haven't even heard of before. If there is a sneaky little list on the MCM please let me know, thanks!


[1/12/2026 8:16 PM] bootineye

[1/12/2026 9:48 PM] devotion3

[1/12/2026 9:54 PM] kazifca
yes


[1/12/2026 9:58 PM] devotion3
thanks!


[1/12/2026 10:09 PM] lazywarlord99
Forgot to ask do I need the creation stuff?


[1/12/2026 10:12 PM] kazifca
no


[1/12/2026 10:12 PM] kazifca
shouldn't


[1/12/2026 10:12 PM] kazifca
beyond the ones I thin everyone gets


[1/12/2026 10:12 PM] kazifca

[1/12/2026 10:16 PM] lazywarlord99

Anyone have any successful settlements?  A lot of my settlers seem to just stand around, and supply lines don't work great.


[1/13/2026 1:49 AM] darthsawyer
I know which gun it is for, I want to know what its base damage is


[1/13/2026 1:59 AM] valintus
Jesus getting to diamond city is an exercise in frustration, as if the mod isnt difficult enough lets add a bunch more enemies and encounters around it just to make sure you bleed after getting fisted.


[1/13/2026 2:48 AM] snazzywazzy
anyone else have issues installing fusion cores into power armors? for me they are able to do the animation of putting the fusion core, but they suddenly disappear and dont have a fusion core after the animation


[1/13/2026 3:01 AM] streikeizer
Damn :PepeCRY:


[1/13/2026 3:03 AM] bootineye
It seems to happen with only the cigarette and for some reason the AFT console 😂


[1/13/2026 3:10 AM] streikeizer
Aight 99% its the sorter patch having the wrong tafs then


[1/13/2026 3:12 AM] bootineye
Awe the cigarette animation does work like 50/50. Overall amazing pack though.  Also is the AFT mod the same one where Curie revives your spouse?


[1/13/2026 3:13 AM] streikeizer
Yep kind scuffed animation. Yeah the aft mod can do that no clue if it actually will.


[1/13/2026 3:14 AM] eccentricmeat
Anyone ever have an issue where you launch the game but for some reason you can't get the game to actually SHOW UP on screen?


[1/13/2026 3:15 AM] eccentricmeat
Like I can hear the menu, if I hover over the logo on the taskbar it shows what SHOULD be on screen, but if I click the game it's like it has been loaded on a monitor that I don't have. I can't change it to either of my actual monitors, my mouse cursor gets stuck on the right side of the screen, if I minimize everything I just see my desktop and not the game... I'm so confused


[1/13/2026 3:16 AM] eccentricmeat
I got it to work the first time I played after downloading/installing the list. But now whenever I launch from ModOrganizer it just won't show up on my screen


[1/13/2026 3:17 AM] eccentricmeat
It isn't crashing either


[1/13/2026 3:18 AM] eccentricmeat
If I edit the INI to play in full screen, it works


[1/13/2026 3:18 AM] eccentricmeat
But I'd prefer to do borderless, which seems to be the issue


[1/13/2026 3:19 AM] streikeizer
Wierd. I have no idea ngl.


[1/13/2026 3:20 AM] eccentricmeat
Yea, especially weird that it worked before and isn't working now, with no changes whatsoever


[1/13/2026 3:35 AM] streikeizer
Fun eh:PepeLaugh:


[1/13/2026 3:35 AM] streikeizer
Did you update btw?


[1/13/2026 3:36 AM] streikeizer
Oh and for everyone who updated. Did you get the enb issue still?


[1/13/2026 3:38 AM] bootineye
No issue with enb at all


[1/13/2026 3:53 AM] sellars
thanks for the update fix my enb issue but just need help the games resolution isnt correct and setting it on default fallout didnt fix it


[1/13/2026 3:55 AM] streikeizer
What resolution do you use?


[1/13/2026 3:56 AM] sellars
4k


[1/13/2026 3:56 AM] streikeizer
:pepo_ooh:


[1/13/2026 3:56 AM] streikeizer
Gotta look for a bit myself not sure where the issue lies. I'm using 1440p myself.


[1/13/2026 3:57 AM] streikeizer
Whats the specific issue? hud not working proper. streched screen?


[1/13/2026 3:57 AM] sellars
yeah when launching games in top left with black borders filling the rest


[1/13/2026 3:58 AM] sellars
everything is right just doesnt fill screen


[1/13/2026 3:59 AM] streikeizer
You changed these I think right?

[1/13/2026 4:04 AM] sellars

[1/13/2026 4:04 AM] streikeizer
Nice good to hear


[1/13/2026 4:53 AM] valintus
are there AK's in the modpack? havent found one yet.


[1/13/2026 5:45 AM] valintus
Legendary insects and animals dont drop legendary gear, is this intentional?

what is the version that should be shown for the modlist on wabbajack 0.5.8.0 is what i see is that correct


[1/13/2026 8:13 AM] lexouav
Hello, I would like to play a faction vs. faction Warfare game, for example military vs. mercenaries, and I would like the military to control almost all of the smart points (around 90%). I've tried all the settings in Warfare ALife Overhaul, giving them a starting bonus, etc., but nothing works. Do you know how to give almost total control of the map to an enemy faction (a bit like the monoliths that control much of the north of the map)? Thank you.


[1/13/2026 9:54 AM] bingusrotundus
Anyone know how to get rid of Weak Muscles or literally any kind affliction in general? All my afflictions say they last for 24 hours. My character slept for 40 hours and none of them went away or decreased in time...  Despite going to Bethany and getting fully healed and cured, no afflictions are gotten rid of. Weak Muscles literally makes the game unplayable and I'm about to break a fucking keyboard at how fucking stupid this god damn effect is and how fucking stupid the fucking grammar of this slop ass mod is.


[1/13/2026 11:06 AM] valintus
These illness's are caused by rads, you have to cure your rads first.


[1/13/2026 11:09 AM] devotion3
does anyone know how to use a controller with this?


[1/13/2026 11:22 AM] darklary
So, when you have radiation sickness, do you NEED a doctor to fix that or are there items that cure rad poisoning?


[1/13/2026 12:05 PM] ashdgrace
what mod is the parts for pete quest from?


[1/13/2026 12:08 PM] darklary
Pete the friendly phantom, I believe?


[1/13/2026 12:12 PM] lexouav
?


[1/13/2026 12:14 PM] darklary
My best guess would be to ask around the Gamma discord, but I personally don't have an answer for you.


[1/13/2026 12:40 PM] thirtyfour17
exiting power armor freezes my game is there a fix what mod is not letting me use it?


[1/13/2026 12:41 PM] thirtyfour17
`also is there any setting i need to change after start up


[1/13/2026 1:15 PM] valintus
Theres a couple meds that can but honestly its cheaper to just get a doc to fix it for 300 caps, then do your best to avoid rads. its when you have around 2 full bars of rads that the debuffs start to spiral into oh shit territory.


[1/13/2026 1:18 PM] blindindark
How do i get crafting jornuls I am lvl 25 and did not finde any ?


[1/13/2026 1:25 PM] valintus
Ive seen some of the legendary crafting journals for sale in diamond city.


[1/13/2026 2:29 PM] dallas9911
The mod that makes you fall when Weak is the most annoying shit I keep falling thru the map


[1/13/2026 2:56 PM] peanuts1582
give yourself via command some cleansing tonic only way i can play this mod


[1/13/2026 2:58 PM] dallas9911
the anti rad drugs dont work lol I spent an hour falling thru hte map to walk to dimond city


[1/13/2026 2:58 PM] kazifca
Falling through the map?


[1/13/2026 3:18 PM] peanuts1582
im now running normal speed only in third person for some reason


[1/13/2026 3:20 PM] kazifca
reload the save


[1/13/2026 3:21 PM] kazifca
if you're not sick, dying or crippled


[1/13/2026 3:22 PM] kazifca
or well, exit and re enter


[1/13/2026 3:22 PM] kazifca
exit saves are fine


[1/13/2026 3:22 PM] peanuts1582
yes ive restarted already


[1/13/2026 3:22 PM] kazifca
🤨


[1/13/2026 3:22 PM] kazifca
You're gonna need to be more descriptive then not much I can extrapolate so far


[1/13/2026 3:22 PM] peanuts1582
i suspect it's some item im carrying or a modifier somewhere


[1/13/2026 3:23 PM] peanuts1582
its liveable it'll probably disappear if i die or something who knows


[1/13/2026 3:24 PM] peanuts1582
seems i spend more time troubleshooting and resetting the mcm than actually playing the game, but yet i cant stop playing


[1/13/2026 3:25 PM] kazifca
Alright, fair enough


[1/13/2026 3:42 PM] beaniepope
just pressed install for the update and then remembered i logged out inside the railroad HQ


[1/13/2026 3:42 PM] beaniepope
this may end poorly we will see


[1/13/2026 4:08 PM] zaja0479
What's the keybind to open ENB?


[1/13/2026 4:30 PM] kazifca
shift+enter


[1/13/2026 4:30 PM] kazifca
wait


[1/13/2026 4:31 PM] kazifca
might be end on the numpad


[1/13/2026 4:31 PM] kazifca
if neither. do the classic


[1/13/2026 4:31 PM] kazifca
press buttons till it opens


[1/13/2026 4:32 PM] ashdgrace
is there any reason the "APC transport" was chosen instead of "APC home on the move"?


[1/13/2026 4:32 PM] ashdgrace
thinking of switching to that one instead of the APC transport since the APC is so underwhelming...


[1/13/2026 5:05 PM] zaja0479
should i download the creations bundle before installing anomaly?\


[1/13/2026 5:06 PM] kazifca
no


[1/13/2026 5:11 PM] zaja0479
sick


[1/13/2026 5:12 PM] zaja0479
one more question, does anything not function as intended if i swap from survival to hard? asking for a friend ofc


[1/13/2026 5:14 PM] kazifca
Probably, wouldn't have a clue


[1/13/2026 5:15 PM] kazifca
never thought about doin it


[1/13/2026 5:17 PM] zaja0479
cool. where can i find more info on the presets? like survival vs immersion?


[1/13/2026 6:36 PM] kazifca
no idea tbh, I generally set survival then go tune my settings

[1/13/2026 7:25 PM] bingusrotundus
Whats the command for that? I'm about to stop using this trash ass modpack because Rad management is the dumbest most poorly thought out system making the game absolutely unplayable and having to visit doctors every 10 minutes or having your dumb fucking character trip over his own feet every 2 seconds is so enraging I'm about to start ripping mods out of this pack. It makes 0 sense and feels sloppy and mediocre as fuck.


[1/13/2026 7:33 PM] kazifca
help "refreshing beverage" 4


[1/13/2026 7:34 PM] kazifca

Hey does anyone like


[1/13/2026 7:40 PM] con6494
Know why cars just randomly detonate when you approach them


[1/13/2026 7:40 PM] con6494
I've had this happen to me numerous times with no explanation


[1/13/2026 7:41 PM] con6494
Okay. Nevermind. I found a mine hidden underneath it, but I'm assuming my low explosives skill is having it instantly detonate


[1/13/2026 7:41 PM] kazifca
generally only when its taking strays


[1/13/2026 7:52 PM] chaptermaster_kaelveydran
Before I download Fallout Anomaly, Does anyone know if the Intel(R) Core(TM) Ultra 7 265F is good enough to handle it? or am I just under the proper specs for FA?


[1/13/2026 7:53 PM] kazifca
Probably


[1/13/2026 7:55 PM] chaptermaster_kaelveydran
That's not very helpful lol


[1/13/2026 7:57 PM] kazifca
I can't guarantee you won the silicon lottery. 
If you've got a CPU enough to run FO4 at solid frames then yeah, probably, is your GPU 8gb


[1/13/2026 7:57 PM] kazifca
I think thats the reco


[1/13/2026 7:58 PM] chaptermaster_kaelveydran
nvidia geforce rtx 5060 ti good enough?


[1/13/2026 7:58 PM] kazifca
:FancyPepe:  stop asking questions and play the game brother


[1/13/2026 7:58 PM] kazifca
you're fine

It's a prebuilt Alienware Aurora Pc designed for gaming

xD I want to but I had similar issues with the Skyrim modlist Nolvus


[1/13/2026 7:58 PM] kazifca
Thats an engine problem


[1/13/2026 7:59 PM] kazifca
the CK is not, great


[1/13/2026 7:59 PM] chaptermaster_kaelveydran
Some dude said Nolvus could almost run on a banana in the cpu slot, then I was told my stuff couldn't handle it so y'know


[1/13/2026 8:00 PM] kazifca
Are you sure?


[1/13/2026 8:00 PM] kazifca
do you need a nasa super computer?


[1/13/2026 8:00 PM] kazifca
or is it a laptop and it can't use any other logic other than the MOB


[1/13/2026 8:01 PM] chaptermaster_kaelveydran
I can't tell if you're being sarcastic or not but I'll just go ahead and install FA so I can stop getting on your nerves lol


[1/13/2026 8:01 PM] kazifca
100% being sarcastic


[1/13/2026 8:01 PM] kazifca
no way you couldn't run nolvus


[1/13/2026 8:01 PM] kazifca
You're overloaded


[1/13/2026 8:02 PM] chaptermaster_kaelveydran
It had many problems, Constant crashes and freezes


[1/13/2026 8:02 PM] kazifca
That sounds like a QC problem, is it still in warranty


[1/13/2026 8:02 PM] chaptermaster_kaelveydran
2100k pc and Nolvus can't seem to run on it xP


[1/13/2026 8:02 PM] chaptermaster_kaelveydran
A lot of the crashes were Occlusion related


[1/13/2026 8:03 PM] kazifca
Thats Nolvus not your computer


[1/13/2026 8:03 PM] chaptermaster_kaelveydran
Seems like they refuse to acknowledge that and want it to be my pc causing the problem


[1/13/2026 8:04 PM] chaptermaster_kaelveydran
What's weird is the easier setting redux crashed more than the ultimate setting which had everything put to the max


[1/13/2026 8:04 PM] kazifca
I mean maybe the LO got wrong, or something about the 50 series drivers might act weirdly with old hardware


[1/13/2026 8:04 PM] kazifca
software*


[1/13/2026 8:04 PM] kazifca
not uncommon


[1/13/2026 8:04 PM] chaptermaster_kaelveydran
Yeah that's true, Skyrim's a grandfather at this point


[1/13/2026 8:05 PM] chaptermaster_kaelveydran
Thanks for the help though Kaz 😄


[1/13/2026 8:05 PM] chaptermaster_kaelveydran
Oh another issue that came up was the Vram limit, Mine being 8 seemed like it was too small


[1/13/2026 8:06 PM] kazifca
Naw man


[1/13/2026 8:06 PM] kazifca
Vram is a scam


[1/13/2026 8:06 PM] kazifca
use optimized textures


[1/13/2026 8:06 PM] chaptermaster_kaelveydran
Nolvus apparently doesn't have optimized textures lol


[1/13/2026 8:06 PM] chaptermaster_kaelveydran
People would point out VRAM being an issue


[1/13/2026 8:07 PM] kazifca
You need a potato CPU & a nasa GPU?


[1/13/2026 8:07 PM] chaptermaster_kaelveydran
I'm really not a tech guy so I got no clue on anything


[1/13/2026 8:07 PM] kazifca
That just, wouldn't run well as, a computer


[1/13/2026 8:07 PM] chaptermaster_kaelveydran
Is the cpu I have bad?


[1/13/2026 8:07 PM] kazifca
naw man


[1/13/2026 8:07 PM] kazifca
you chillen


[1/13/2026 8:07 PM] kazifca
your rig tight


[1/13/2026 8:07 PM] chaptermaster_kaelveydran
hah, Thanks


[1/13/2026 8:08 PM] kazifca
you should be able to play most games


[1/13/2026 8:08 PM] kazifca
Pay attention to texture sizes though, optimized or not, if you're on a 2k panel you won't see 8k detail


[1/13/2026 8:08 PM] chaptermaster_kaelveydran
Well I'm able to play a heavily modded Minecraft with no issues, Nolvus seems to be the only trouble child


[1/13/2026 8:08 PM] kazifca
Bro can play heavily modded minecraft with no issues


[1/13/2026 8:08 PM] kazifca
shaders too I bet

Yup

[1/13/2026 8:09 PM] kazifca
Actually requires the single most powerful thread to run like 300 mods with stability

Try running 650+ mods with no issues haha

Oh 100%, She knows basically 95% of everything (the 5% being tablets since she hates them)


[1/13/2026 8:12 PM] chaptermaster_kaelveydran
I think she's been doing it for what 30+ years now?

for anomely


[1/13/2026 8:25 PM] kazifca
During the downloading process, yes, after its finished you can delete the downloads folder and cut that down by over half


[1/13/2026 8:25 PM] landobutitslowercasel
okay so like 400?

Wanted to thank you man for answering my beginner questions earlier without shaming me. It's been a good year since I picked up Anomaly and there were plenty of changes. It's been a really good experience. Solid 3 and a half hours in and having a very immersive and enjoyable experience. Thank you again man


[1/13/2026 9:21 PM] kazifca
Hey, no problem man, enjoy, it is pretty fun


[1/13/2026 10:29 PM] bootineye
Is there a way to turn off the prompt that pops up saying "welcome to Anomaly." It comes up right after you finish making your character and it overwrites a prompt specifically for the ATF mod


[1/13/2026 11:14 PM] valintus
Wait i can delete the downloads folder?


[1/13/2026 11:15 PM] kazifca
Once you've installed the modpack I don't see why not


[1/13/2026 11:15 PM] kazifca
you'll have to redownload all the mods to reinstall the pack tho


[1/14/2026 12:30 AM] eccentricmeat
Sorry just saw this now. I have not updated the list in the last few days, so I can give that a try later and see if borderless works again.

Idk man if u dont like it do something about it or stop playing?

Ur whining and ranting is not helping anything, moreover i guess MOD developer is not gonna interact with ur gripes at all nor help u with that attitude. They dont owe you a single dime xd


[1/14/2026 5:28 AM] bingusrotundus
"Do something about it" why the fk do you think I posted about it retrd. You literally can't disable the mods on mod organizer or the game won't start and there's no options for it in the config menus, genius.


[1/14/2026 5:38 AM] niqzu
Well you could start modding yourself to make your own modpack and not whine like a toddler on internet. Or better yet behave and maybe someone might atleast want to help you.


[1/14/2026 5:38 AM] bingusrotundus
Ahh so you ARE stupid.


[1/14/2026 5:39 AM] niqzu
Yeah i am stupid since i am engaging with you.


[1/14/2026 6:07 AM] streikeizer
The rad system will always stay. Dont you worry about that. We designed it as main part of the setup. And I aint gonna remove 15 mods to just please 10% of people who play it. Dont like it? Go make your own pack or play something else.

Hey there 🙂


[1/14/2026 7:43 AM] nexusnemesis1
Hey there is there are way to check if all mods a  downloaded


[1/14/2026 7:43 AM] nexusnemesis1
I played now like 60 hours but did not find an Single ak variant or an mp5


[1/14/2026 7:44 AM] nexusnemesis1
And my Charakter is lvl 39 all vendors sell did not sell anything like this


[1/14/2026 7:57 AM] kazifca
Don’t think there’s an MP5 in the modpack off the bat unless that was added recently


[1/14/2026 8:10 AM] streikeizer
There is no mp5, there should be an Ak variant by combined arms. But I'm shuffeling some stuff around to hopefully make some weapons appear. and make some less appear.


[1/14/2026 8:12 AM] sonk9870
Hi I got thermal visor.How to open themal visor?


[1/14/2026 8:19 AM] nexusnemesis1
I found this List so ist not real


[1/14/2026 8:19 AM] nexusnemesis1
With scar and lot of ak variants and more


[1/14/2026 8:23 AM] streikeizer
Should be a hotkey somewhere in the mcm


[1/14/2026 8:38 AM] valintus
The default was shift + U for me.


[1/14/2026 8:39 AM] valintus
ive been finding 9x39 ammo but have yet to see a vss, holding out hope though lol probably just unlucky. T_T


[1/14/2026 9:36 AM] qcsurvival
Hello, I have a quick question about gas masks. Is there an option for… I can barely see with the mask.


[1/14/2026 9:41 AM] kazifca
Go into mcm, under gameplay or immersion, look for damn Apocalypse, go to the radiation module, scroll to the bottom, turn off the visual overlay


[1/14/2026 9:41 AM] qcsurvival
ook good::)


[1/14/2026 11:23 AM] streikeizer
Wierd still since i updated the mcm to include these settings:hmmn:


[1/14/2026 11:29 AM] carl_os
is there an easier way to scrap stuff than dropping into the world and workshop-mode scrapping?


[1/14/2026 11:29 AM] carl_os
I know there's the universal scrapper, and the portable scrapper, but they seem to ignore salvage perks


[1/14/2026 11:31 AM] kazifca
MCM is weird man, sometimes it saves my 7000 settings in my modpack other times it doesn't

[1/14/2026 11:32 AM] kazifca
I went 700 deep in the last list then realized I had broken precombines, but every single time my HUD and settings would reset lmao


[1/14/2026 11:32 AM] kazifca
This time I'm 500 deep and it saves, everything?


[1/14/2026 11:47 AM] .the_raging_scotsman
abyone know how to cure illnessses


[1/14/2026 11:53 AM] kazifca
gonna have to be more specific man


[1/14/2026 12:21 PM] streikeizer
Thats true sadly


[1/14/2026 12:40 PM] kazifca
Its occasionally frustrating, been pretty good recently, maybe I got better at LO or sumn


[1/14/2026 1:04 PM] purpleh4zzed
yup just had to long press it for me to work.


[1/14/2026 1:18 PM] .the_raging_scotsman
i have an infection idk how to cure it @Kazifca


[1/14/2026 1:23 PM] kazifca
My first assumption would be antibiotics


[1/14/2026 1:23 PM] bellusci
Hi everyone, i started the mod yesterday, at the begining of the game I have two doubts:

1 - I have a ton of diseases like "nuclear diahrea" "lithium lung" and noo amount of rad away seem to cure it. What can I do to heal? Searched everywhere and no answers
2 - The museum (presto garvey) mission just at the start, I cant use the power armor... Am i supposed to fight the deathclaw naked?


[1/14/2026 1:23 PM] kazifca
If it's radiation illness, help "cleansing tonic" 4


[1/14/2026 1:24 PM] kazifca
Fight the deathclaw naked


[1/14/2026 1:24 PM] bellusci
Always wanted to brawl a deathclaw butt naked, guess this is the day... but the diseases oh man, no way to cure it on the start


[1/14/2026 1:25 PM] kazifca
^


[1/14/2026 1:40 PM] .the_raging_scotsman
what so a clensing tonic will get rid of this debuff does it matter what type of debuff or do most cure with the tonic ? @Kazifca


[1/14/2026 1:45 PM] kazifca
you haven't told me what debuff you have so, try both


[1/14/2026 2:04 PM] bellusci
Also Im getting rads, a lot of it, even using gas mask (800 AR) all the time, not enough radaway to contain it


[1/14/2026 2:16 PM] kazifca
AR means little to IRA, do you have a filter in


[1/14/2026 2:22 PM] bellusci
Well the mask hud is constantly hid, don`t know why, but the last time it showed was 66% and was still gathering rads


[1/14/2026 2:24 PM] kazifca
Go into mcm and turn it on


[1/14/2026 2:24 PM] kazifca
set a toggle hotkey if it's fussy


[1/14/2026 2:29 PM] bellusci
cant find the option


[1/14/2026 2:30 PM] kazifca
gas masks of the wasteland?


[1/14/2026 2:34 PM] bellusci
it says it`s on... but it`s not haha


[1/14/2026 2:36 PM] bellusci
anyway, i changed the filter to test, so it`s 100%, and even on sanctuary, no rain, nothing, still gathering rads


[1/14/2026 2:36 PM] kazifca
hm


[1/14/2026 2:36 PM] kazifca
You've restarted and everything too?


[1/14/2026 2:37 PM] bellusci
yeah, it was like this yesterday too, but i got tired of playing 100% of the time debuffed and decided to talk to someone here, can`t figure out what the heck im doing wrong


[1/14/2026 2:39 PM] kazifca
@Overseer StreikEizer beyond me


[1/14/2026 2:57 PM] bellusci
I even tryed the holotape to set radiation only on storms, rain, etc. Never on pleasent weather, but I still gather rads on base with nothing happening


[1/14/2026 2:58 PM] bellusci
radboy is readying 700+ radiation (seek shelter)... don`t know what else to do


[1/14/2026 3:01 PM] bellusci
BTW, used the cheat holotape to heal me, only removed rads but it kept accumulating after, and it doesn`t strip away the ton of diseases it got me... im completely debuffed


[1/14/2026 3:05 PM] bellusci
The rads seems to be going up by "you receive additional tissue damage from ingested rads" ... but I only ate fruits and purified water. I'm completely lost at this point


[1/14/2026 3:32 PM] streikeizer
f2 maybe?


[1/14/2026 3:32 PM] streikeizer
I dunno I dont get the issue 100%


[1/14/2026 3:47 PM] bellusci
Is there any console commands to clear my illness at least?


[1/14/2026 3:48 PM] bellusci
I tried turning the entire system off, even that doesnt work


[1/14/2026 3:55 PM] streikeizer
In diamond city the doctor should cure it if you pay for radiation treatment


[1/14/2026 3:56 PM] streikeizer
Covenant Bunker hill Diamond city are easy places to find em.


[1/14/2026 3:56 PM] streikeizer
Costs 300 caps should cure all


[1/14/2026 3:56 PM] streikeizer



[1/14/2026 3:57 PM] streikeizer
This is how it works still and always has


[1/14/2026 3:57 PM] streikeizer
Only Doctors can heal Illness


[1/14/2026 3:57 PM] streikeizer
The rest can be cured by the meds

I have no clue if there are things like skyrims keyboard hotbinding overlay in fallout 4. But If anyone knows of it or something like it. Let me know then I can implement all those pics into one of those


[1/14/2026 4:00 PM] streikeizer
And IRA needs to be 100% removed if not you will keep getting rads.


[1/14/2026 4:01 PM] streikeizer
Oh and you cant use the PA without training. You need to find one of the trainers BOS atom cats Bunker hill etc


[1/14/2026 4:02 PM] streikeizer
So go kill that deathclaw without PA

How? Can`t find a straight answer anywhere, all I know is im dying and have no ideia why. Havent ate any raw food, only drink water from the well I made on base or purified water, and it keeps getting worse with no way to cure it


[1/14/2026 4:07 PM] streikeizer
Go and visit a doctor in dc


[1/14/2026 4:07 PM] streikeizer
Cure your rads there. if its still occuring its bugged.


[1/14/2026 4:08 PM] bellusci
I`ll try to make it there, probably will die on the way lol


[1/14/2026 4:08 PM] bellusci
and still don`t know what actually made me sick


[1/14/2026 4:09 PM] streikeizer
coc DiamondCityExt


[1/14/2026 4:09 PM] streikeizer
in console


[1/14/2026 4:24 PM] bellusci
The doctor cleared it all, but I still don`t know what caused the sickness in first place, any tips on that?


[1/14/2026 4:51 PM] kazifca
Makes a lot of sense why I don’t be getting sick, my character is usually a raging alcoholic


[1/14/2026 5:41 PM] streikeizer
Keep an eye out for the audio notifications. and there should be some popups on the screen noticing your ira lvl

[1/14/2026 9:52 PM] aphoniah
Do you have to do something to make the start spawning or am I just stupid unlucky


[1/14/2026 9:54 PM] kazifca
Probably just crazy unlucky


[1/14/2026 9:54 PM] kazifca
happened to me before


[1/14/2026 10:02 PM] aphoniah
Damn okay


[1/14/2026 10:13 PM] perinthia
as far as i know, they are specifically placed in certain areas, i think 1 is in vault 81, and another is in vault tec regional HQ from my adventures


[1/14/2026 10:14 PM] aphoniah
I’ll check vault 81 haven’t yet


[1/14/2026 10:14 PM] perinthia
im not sure exactly where in vault 81 it may be, i just remember finding 1 there on a previous run


[1/14/2026 10:14 PM] kazifca
They're rare loot


[1/14/2026 10:15 PM] aphoniah
Just wanted to make sure there wasn’t something I missed to make them spawn or if they already did no matter


[1/14/2026 10:15 PM] kazifca
you can find them in trash cans, there might be some guaranteed spots tho


[1/14/2026 10:16 PM] perinthia
ah i think the ones im talking about are guaranteed spawns then, since they were not in a container and were on shelves. iv yet to find one randomly spawn, so i must have gotten unlucky there


[1/14/2026 10:16 PM] kazifca
what level and how much luck do you have :FancyPepe:


[1/14/2026 10:16 PM] perinthia
im currently lvl 43, but my luck is only 3

Stack milk of human kindness already


[1/14/2026 10:17 PM] aphoniah
My luck is 4 atm still nothing might raise it just in case


[1/14/2026 10:18 PM] aphoniah
But thanks I’ll check 81 and see if that’s the case.


[1/14/2026 10:22 PM] perinthia
idk if its the same mod that we have, but when looking online i found this "Water chips can also be crafted with advanced nuclear physicists and science perks" for the IMMERSIVE WATER PURIFICATION mod


[1/14/2026 10:22 PM] kazifca
yea


[1/14/2026 10:22 PM] perinthia
ah okay, so that would also be an option if your desperate for them

Legendary Scavenger is kind of busted... basically duplicating resources

[1/14/2026 10:29 PM] perinthia
would reviving, or spawning in NPCs cause things to break? (the Atom cats got wiped out in a massive ghoul attack before i could even interact with them)


[1/14/2026 10:33 PM] aphoniah
No sure id save and try it just incase it does ?


[1/14/2026 10:35 PM] danguskhan.
Hey, I’m unable to find or open any cigarette packs anymore, have found one all day. Is there a possibility that mod broke ?


[1/14/2026 10:53 PM] aphoniah
Some are opened and as junk for components. Some are able to open to get cigs.


[1/14/2026 10:54 PM] aphoniah
Literally after talk about the water chip I found one in med tek. Just got 50 in science and chem wonder if that had anything to do with it.

[1/15/2026 7:56 AM] kazifca
you make them and buy the material


[1/15/2026 8:10 AM] garyg3
really need some help to reenable saving


[1/15/2026 8:15 AM] kazifca
Smoke a cigarette


[1/15/2026 8:44 AM] garyg3
beyond that


[1/15/2026 8:44 AM] garyg3
the normal way hence the reenable part


[1/15/2026 8:48 AM] kazifca
No clue, never thought about doing it


[1/15/2026 8:48 AM] kazifca
Probably a mod out there that does it


[1/15/2026 8:49 AM] kazifca
Probably a mod in there that does it, spend awhile in mcm

[1/15/2026 9:33 AM] ashdgrace
oh im close to that one!


[1/15/2026 9:52 AM] ashdgrace

Hello, I have a question: if we do not wear a mask outside when the weather is nice, can we be exposed to radiation?


[1/15/2026 12:33 PM] kazifca
depends on your settings


[1/15/2026 12:34 PM] qcsurvival
Okay, they are configured for immersion.


[1/15/2026 12:36 PM] qcsurvival
Do the fruits and vegetables from the garden emit radiation, or is it safe to consume them? I don't see any radiation when I eat them.


[1/15/2026 12:37 PM] kazifca
if it's immersion in gas masks of the wasteland, then no I don't think air radiation is a thing and I'm pretty mask damage is disabled


[1/15/2026 12:37 PM] kazifca
Uh, maybe? depends on your perks, lead belly for ex.


[1/15/2026 12:40 PM] qcsurvival
Okay, thanks for the info. I suspected the SKK Stalker mod wasn't necessary; there's the NPC Travel mod, and since the game has a difficulty level, an encounter from time to time is enough.


[1/15/2026 12:41 PM] kazifca
one of the things I'm working on is downsizing and integration because I think there should be far more danger in this modpack :FancyPepe:, more npcs, more ghouls, way more scary wildlife


[1/15/2026 12:42 PM] qcsurvival
Okay, yes, there's a mod for hunting animals, I don't know if it's mutant.


[1/15/2026 12:44 PM] qcsurvival
I saw rabbits but no other animals yet.


[1/15/2026 12:45 PM] qcsurvival
I thought he had the Ark mod for hunting:)


[1/15/2026 12:45 PM] kazifca
No the hunting system is pretty simple, def needs to be reigned in a little though or integrated better


[1/15/2026 12:49 PM] qcsurvival
Okay, yes, I can't think of another word for it. It was definitely him who was in the mod pak


[1/15/2026 12:52 PM] qcsurvival
Open Commonwealth is not up to date for the mod pack, or you have decided not to include it.


[1/15/2026 12:53 PM] kazifca
Naw Imma go a diff direction, my pitch is gonna be more of a passion project for myself as a DM


[1/15/2026 12:54 PM] kazifca
Plus, wouldn't learn if I relied on other peoples work to do it for me :FancyPepe:


[1/15/2026 12:55 PM] qcsurvival
Okay, are you a word developer or just an engine?


[1/15/2026 12:55 PM] kazifca
You're gonna have to rephrase that


[1/15/2026 12:56 PM] qcsurvival
are you a developer or a modder?


[1/15/2026 12:57 PM] qcsurvival
I am French, ah, translation


[1/15/2026 12:57 PM] qcsurvival
ahha


[1/15/2026 12:57 PM] kazifca
Neither atm, I have a few working patches for myself, working on both, step one is integrating everything with you are exceptional. I'm a live sound engineer


[1/15/2026 12:59 PM] qcsurvival
Okay, good, thanks for the info. I'm getting back into the mod pack. See you later:)

Good luck

[1/15/2026 2:06 PM] kazifca
Don't gotta downgrade


[1/15/2026 5:03 PM] darklary
I'm not sure what happened or why, but my character has a phantom -2 agility. I don't have rads, not Ill, not crippled, not overencumbered.


[1/15/2026 5:03 PM] darklary
Not showing in status either.


[1/15/2026 5:07 PM] mavrick1282
Is there a video or doc on the medical system?


[1/15/2026 5:11 PM] darklary
I think my character is in some kind of spaghetti code doom spiral. I just loaded a save from when I went to far harbor, and was 7 levels ealier. had like 100 ap, now, at level 47 I have 19. What is going on with my character?


[1/15/2026 5:11 PM] mavrick1282
good luck getting an answer on anything in here


[1/15/2026 5:24 PM] darklary
I think It's ballistic plates maybe? Like, something going weird with them that the agility reduction is stacking and never going away.


[1/15/2026 5:25 PM] mavrick1282
if its crafted armor try making a new set and see if the balistic stats change


[1/15/2026 5:25 PM] darklary
nah like, the plate items you can find and put on for temporary damage reduction.


[1/15/2026 5:26 PM] mavrick1282
oh shit yea, dont know my bad


[1/15/2026 5:26 PM] mavrick1282
Im trying to figure out how to add the base cheat terminal because all the options are taken out of the one in this mod pack


[1/15/2026 5:29 PM] mavrick1282
these fuckers even fixed tgm command in the game


[1/15/2026 5:29 PM] mavrick1282
fuck my life


[1/15/2026 5:34 PM] darklary
Yeah the dificulty took some getting used to for me as well.


[1/15/2026 5:34 PM] darklary
And I had the brilliant idea to try and do melee build.


[1/15/2026 5:34 PM] darklary
Unless you like suffering, don't do that lol.


[1/15/2026 5:53 PM] mavrick1282
I was able to figure out how to add the cration kit bounty hunting and ghoulification mod to the modpack so I am doing cooper howard build


[1/15/2026 5:54 PM] mavrick1282
Do you know how to heal yellow damaged areas on your body? do you have to go to a doctor?


[1/15/2026 5:55 PM] azirblackfang
Anyone know how to re-enable enemies on compass or is it impossible?


[1/15/2026 5:56 PM] darklary
IB prophen for limbs and body. Med-ex for head.


[1/15/2026 5:57 PM] darklary
Not sure myself. Don't have them active, I just do my best without it. Reminding myself this is meant to be closer to stalker anomaly. Hence the name.


[1/15/2026 6:09 PM] mavrick1282
Thank you so much man. One more question if you are willing to answer. Is V.A.T.S. disabled in this mod?


[1/15/2026 6:14 PM] darklary
Yes(?) pressing G activates a sort of bullet time that consumes AP. But I have yet to find the key bind for actual VATS. I am fairly certain it has been replaced with VAFS.


[1/15/2026 6:15 PM] mavrick1282
Hell yea I perfer bullet time to be honest


[1/15/2026 6:15 PM] darklary
You'd like how I've built my character I think. The way my gear is, not the actual stat spread and skills.


[1/15/2026 6:16 PM] crimsonairo
I saw somewhere this modpack was deprecated and not supported anymore, is that true?


[1/15/2026 6:18 PM] mavrick1282
tell me about it, im interested


[1/15/2026 6:18 PM] crimsonairo
after looking around that seems to have been a lie someone was spouting.


[1/15/2026 6:19 PM] mavrick1282
I mean its up to date, but staff wont help you with any questions


[1/15/2026 6:20 PM] darklary
Melee/shotgun build with heavy drug use. Lots of Jet, and a legendary piece of body armor that slows time for like 8 seconds when I get bellow 30% health. Plus a gold desert eagle that slows time when I aim for a few seconds.


[1/15/2026 6:20 PM] mavrick1282
If you have any questions, i will attempt to help you if i can


[1/15/2026 6:20 PM] mavrick1282
Hell yea that sounds fun, im going to try and perk into chem damage with the ghoul also


[1/15/2026 6:20 PM] crimsonairo
why is that?


[1/15/2026 6:21 PM] mavrick1282
I really dont know, Iv been asking for help with minor things for a week and had to brute force it because help is non existent here unless your @Leonard  ❤️


[1/15/2026 7:58 PM] mavrick1282
So why do the grenades blow you up from a mile away? @-Blaze-


[1/15/2026 8:28 PM] darklary
Oh yeah the radius on those is massive


[1/15/2026 8:28 PM] darklary
and sometimes kill ya through walls


[1/15/2026 8:45 PM] mavrick1282
thats exactly what happened


[1/15/2026 9:07 PM] garyg3
who knows where to or how to learn to wear power armor?


[1/15/2026 9:15 PM] darklary
theres a few spots I've found.


[1/15/2026 9:15 PM] darklary
Bunker hill is the one the game tells ya about when you pick up the power armor training next to the set on top of the museum in concord.


[1/15/2026 9:16 PM] garyg3
ok. ill have to gear up for that trek. 2 hours into the mod and ive died "SO" many times


[1/15/2026 9:16 PM] darklary
Oh yeah, the opening is ROUGH.


[1/15/2026 9:17 PM] darklary
You'll also need 2k caps...just to save you the trouble of getting there without the money like I did.


[1/15/2026 9:17 PM] darklary
if you bring 3k, he teaches you AND gives you armor.


[1/15/2026 9:17 PM] garyg3
i appreciate that. this will get interesting


[1/15/2026 9:57 PM] mavrick1282
yall staff goofey for not having a tag, yall need to make @Leonard  a staff member to help people. Because he is a civi and he does more then yall

Is this voice constantly telling me "Radiation levels: Sick" or is she saying "Radiation levels: Safe"??

💯

[1/16/2026 12:05 AM] lv1metapod
I have heard it so many times I can't tell what's being said 😂


[1/16/2026 12:06 AM] kazifca
Safe as far as I know

{Reactions}
💙

[1/16/2026 12:09 AM] lv1metapod
Thank you. And while I have been through the guides and whatnot, I think I've having a difficult time understanding the UI of the gas mask in the top left. Any pointers where to refresh my knowledge? (Idk when it's appropriate to replace a filter and idk how serious damage to the mask is)


[1/16/2026 12:11 AM] kazifca
Generally speaking, when your filter is about to run out your screen will get blurred, if you're good at keeping and using cover in engagements then you can basically always get away with changing your filter at 5% (when your vision goes blurry)


[1/16/2026 12:12 AM] kazifca
Gas mask damage is hefty and they all break fairly fast, thats something I'm currently working on makng a perk to alter


[1/16/2026 12:12 AM] lv1metapod
Interesting. I don't recall ever seeing it below 100% but I still get random spikes of rads. Maybe that's because of the damage.


[1/16/2026 12:12 AM] lv1metapod
I absolutely love Anomaly, it's just been a while and it's a lot to remember lol


[1/16/2026 12:13 AM] kazifca
Naw its all good, depending on your settings you'll get constant or less use out of your mask


[1/16/2026 12:14 AM] kazifca
I generally have it radioactive 24/7 and I enjoy managing that system pretty constantly, even with combat


[1/16/2026 12:14 AM] kazifca
I stopped paying attention to the widget due to it being, finicky


[1/16/2026 12:14 AM] kazifca
the blurred vision is a better more consistent indicator


[1/16/2026 12:14 AM] lv1metapod
So you just go off the visuals instead of the UI... iteresting.


[1/16/2026 12:15 AM] lv1metapod
I will take that into consideration, thank you 🙂
And thinking she's saying "Sick" instead of "Safe" has been stressing me out too 😂


[1/16/2026 12:15 AM] kazifca
it's the accent, throws me off too


[1/16/2026 12:16 AM] kazifca
More like a little more minimal of a UI


[1/16/2026 12:16 AM] kazifca
Tactical reload isn't in there so I still like seeing how much is in mags


[1/16/2026 12:16 AM] kazifca
and AP is nice


[1/16/2026 12:17 AM] kazifca
If you add in AI mods, the hidden bar becomes semi useless depending on which ones


[1/16/2026 12:17 AM] lv1metapod
Yeah for sure. I need to figure out sleeping bags or camping or whatever. I had to completely restart because I got into a position where I was sleep deprived and it made me keep falling over every few steps (and falling through the map lol)


[1/16/2026 12:18 AM] lv1metapod
That's all part of the fun though I reckon 😂


[1/16/2026 12:18 AM] kazifca
Caffine!


[1/16/2026 12:18 AM] lv1metapod
I hadn't even made it to concord yet! 😂

[1/16/2026 12:20 AM] lv1metapod
Oh trust me I know. I've been trying to play through that mission for 2 days lol


[1/16/2026 12:20 AM] kazifca
This is worth adding in


[1/16/2026 12:21 AM] kazifca
100% fits the aesthetic


[1/16/2026 12:21 AM] kazifca
not too op


[1/16/2026 12:21 AM] lv1metapod
Ohh my bad I assumed you meant you added it to the modpack, I didn't bother checking your roles first lol


[1/16/2026 12:21 AM] kazifca

is there any way to keep my fov while I play? tried to change the ini files to no avail


[1/16/2026 12:58 AM] kazifca
Give Bethini a shot and see if she agrees


[1/16/2026 12:58 AM] kazifca
you'll have to locate bethini in the MO2 folder (I think, I'm pretty sure), make sure you close MO2 then run bethini


[1/16/2026 1:10 AM] lv1metapod
I love Bethini. I crank those sliders so hard 😂  Still trying to find the max draw/render distance the game can ACTUALLY handle on it's engine.


[1/16/2026 1:10 AM] lv1metapod
Like, I know my computer can take it, but I don't think the game engine can.


[1/16/2026 1:11 AM] kazifca
You're probably throttling your game on draw calls more than anything


[1/16/2026 1:11 AM] lv1metapod
Who knows. But I do enjoy being able to snipe people from a ridiculous distance.

{Reactions}
❤️

[1/16/2026 1:12 AM] kazifca
This got explained to me recently, you can throw your render up, and you can basically throw, all the stats up as the game realistically isn't that intensive


[1/16/2026 1:12 AM] kazifca
if the previsibines and PRPs are in order


[1/16/2026 1:12 AM] kazifca
and ofc, your machine can handle it


[1/16/2026 1:13 AM] lv1metapod
Idk what those words mean but 😂  My machine definitely can take it.


[1/16/2026 1:13 AM] kazifca
no one optimizes for renderdistance 7, but you COULD with a committed heart


[1/16/2026 1:14 AM] lv1metapod
Last time I played Anomaly I had it to where I could snipe people on that abandoned boat (Where 1 raider spawned with power armor) all the way from the other bridge/Marlborough house


[1/16/2026 1:15 AM] kazifca
Very cool, the AI is not nearly aggressive enough to warrant such caution though


[1/16/2026 1:15 AM] kazifca
Live on the edge


[1/16/2026 1:15 AM] kazifca
stand five feet away and hip fire that sniper


[1/16/2026 1:15 AM] kazifca
thats gambling


[1/16/2026 1:16 AM] lv1metapod
😂 Yeah but. I know it doesn't look like much distance but in Fo4 to be able to hit (or even see) and enemy at that range is so cool

Shooting from the O's to the X.


[1/16/2026 1:17 AM] kazifca
while I don't support it as the mod is, not great for gameplay loop, probably one of the few instances you could build around real.ai and it's sheer utter comical chaos


[1/16/2026 1:18 AM] lv1metapod
Hm. Just mainly engine restrictions I take it making it a bad idea?
And why does no one optimize for render 7? How "far" is that?


[1/16/2026 1:20 AM] kazifca
There's a long list of reasons realistically, most of it beyond the person boils down to the engine literally can't handle it


[1/16/2026 1:20 AM] kazifca
The CK runs well, if you spend an egregious amount of time learning the niches to make it run well


[1/16/2026 1:22 AM] kazifca
Also, most people just wouldn't have the hardware to run render distance 7, it's too many draw calls which (I could be incorrect), leads to tanked frames and a metric ton of draw calls


[1/16/2026 1:22 AM] kazifca
another limitation from my understanding, is papyrus is, slow


[1/16/2026 1:23 AM] kazifca
Easy to start learning and navigating once you find the resources, but slow


[1/16/2026 1:24 AM] kazifca
There realistically, would be a way to optimize for something like that, but it's an open source community right, so accessibility to learn & be wrong are generally on peoples priority list


[1/16/2026 1:31 AM] kazifca
Lastly, I can't answer that genuinely as I couldn't run the game with that setting but, I think you have five cells of render followed by LOD's? the setting is uGridsToLoad = 7 I think

anyone know what mod makes you trip over from muscle fatigue so i can turn that shit off? I keep ragdolling every 5 minutes and falling through the map, trying to get to a doctor to cure radiation sickness and ive been walking there for the last 30 minutes cos i keep falling through and either having to reload a save or wait for my character to get teleported back up. Actually may be the worst mod ive ever seen made

Bethini


[1/16/2026 10:20 AM] darklary
Yeah once you have rad sickness you need a doctor to cure it. OR, a cleansing drink. But the doc's services to just wipe your rads is cheaper.


[1/16/2026 11:18 AM] rud87
mb they should have made this obvious by simply deleting the BIG WARNING that says it requires the downgraded version

Thats, odd


[1/16/2026 11:23 AM] kazifca
I don't think it reads anything but the determined install and download folder

im not sure whats up its def a wabbajack issue. Though knowing I dont need to downgrade is a big help too


[1/16/2026 11:26 AM] kazifca
Wabbajack seems optimal for getting folks started on their journey of suffering and pain through modding

Not quite used for that in that degree tho

Theres a chance it'll fail to download the ENB. If that happens, there's a message in the announcements channel with a link that will actually WORK.

Ill look into that thanks


[1/16/2026 11:57 AM] darklary
it's not pinned, but if you search for "ENB" and scroll down a bit, you should find it.


[1/16/2026 12:24 PM] streikeizer

try sleeping in a bed?


[1/16/2026 12:58 PM] kazifca
Thats odd


[1/16/2026 12:59 PM] shaggyrogers0420
ohhhh nvm it did a quick save is there no way to hard save?


[1/16/2026 1:00 PM] kazifca

Hey guys, sorry for the random question, but is there a perk or something to enable Butchery? Like of mole rats etc


[1/16/2026 1:03 PM] killthemind
I'm wielding a knife but the prompt isn't showing, survival and zoology are >30


[1/16/2026 1:03 PM] killthemind
Am I missing something?


[1/16/2026 1:04 PM] kazifca
It's not Immersive hunting overhaul, you don't need to hold the knife, but the hotkey for the butchering/skinning/harvesting options might be changed from F


[1/16/2026 1:04 PM] kazifca
Look for Hunter of the commonwealth I think


[1/16/2026 1:06 PM] killthemind
In mcm settings?


[1/16/2026 1:06 PM] kazifca
yes


[1/16/2026 1:07 PM] killthemind
I don't see anything for a hotkey


[1/16/2026 1:07 PM] kazifca
Hotkey manager?


[1/16/2026 1:07 PM] killthemind
Wait

> Use activate key

Is ON, is this it?


[1/16/2026 1:08 PM] kazifca
If its in hunter of the common wealth


[1/16/2026 1:08 PM] kazifca
probably


[1/16/2026 1:09 PM] killthemind
Yep, works now


[1/16/2026 1:09 PM] killthemind
Thank you!


[1/16/2026 1:11 PM] darklary
The devs mentioned something in the update notes they changed the butcher key from f to...O I think?


[1/16/2026 1:12 PM] peanuts1582
I agree, the tripping is so idiotic, because it just clips you through the map and makes you insta-die in fights so you can't even travel and get a remedy


[1/16/2026 1:26 PM] chmonyablyat
Hi guys. Any news about Russian translation for last version?


[1/16/2026 1:28 PM] kazifca
I'm sure if there is a Russian translation, that's a very common thing on nexus though for a lot of the mods currently in the pack I think


[1/16/2026 1:31 PM] chmonyablyat
No, I'm not stupid enough to believe they made a Russian patch for this build, but still...

[1/16/2026 1:57 PM] ashdgrace
perfect, thanks mate


[1/16/2026 2:54 PM] bellusci
Can someone confirm if in anoomaly mod pack there is the mod to give a single bullet for NPCs to make them use the gun you want?


[1/16/2026 3:20 PM] darklary
I am 99% sure that works, yes.


[1/16/2026 3:22 PM] stealthavenger
hi peeps, quick question. anyone know why my game is launching in a small box window top left of screen?


[1/16/2026 3:28 PM] kazifca
I dunno but my first inclination is something to do with resolution so, find bethini in your profile folder and close MO2 and take a look at bethini and apply reco tweaks, see if that makes a diff


[1/16/2026 3:31 PM] bellusci
Thx ❤️


[1/16/2026 3:32 PM] bellusci
btw great work guys, the game is really fun to play with the modpack, been having a great time revisiting the game, thanks to all involved in the project


[1/16/2026 3:40 PM] stealthavenger
turns out it was resolution scale


[1/16/2026 3:41 PM] stealthavenger
but now i cant get my controller to work lol i like to play fallout with controller


[1/16/2026 3:41 PM] kazifca
Ya I can't help you there


[1/16/2026 3:42 PM] stealthavenger
no idea why this mod packs has blocked it


[1/16/2026 3:42 PM] kazifca
It shouldn't


[1/16/2026 3:42 PM] kazifca
there's controller support somewhere


[1/16/2026 3:42 PM] kazifca
I just don't have a clue how to do it


[1/16/2026 3:54 PM] knowing_goyim
guys i need some help


[1/16/2026 3:54 PM] knowing_goyim
i want the boston riot armor


[1/16/2026 3:55 PM] kazifca
More descriptive


[1/16/2026 3:55 PM] knowing_goyim
is the 0.5.8.0 the newest update?


[1/16/2026 3:55 PM] knowing_goyim
on wabbajack?


[1/16/2026 3:56 PM] knowing_goyim
with the riot armor


[1/16/2026 3:56 PM] knowing_goyim
i'm looking at the announcements and i dont quite understand them bc there's no changelog in wabba


[1/16/2026 3:56 PM] knowing_goyim
and the previous announcement said dont update if you already have installed successfully and i dont wanna bork my stuff up


[1/16/2026 3:57 PM] kazifca
Uh look through Eizers messages in here, you might find a better answer to your question


[1/16/2026 3:57 PM] knowing_goyim
yeah they're confusing


[1/16/2026 3:58 PM] knowing_goyim
Update on wabbajack now.

Changed the binding of the hunting mod from F to O
And updated the sorter.

I dont think its 100% save safe. But waiting 72 hours in an interior cell should also work.


[1/16/2026 3:58 PM] knowing_goyim
but there's no changelog is it actually on wabba or just that googledrive still


[1/16/2026 3:58 PM] kazifca
I haven't touched anomaly in a bit, but it says DC guard armor replacer in the announcements so check diamond city?


[1/16/2026 3:58 PM] kazifca
That might give a more direct answer


[1/16/2026 3:59 PM] knowing_goyim
dang


[1/16/2026 4:00 PM] knowing_goyim
i guess i could just install the mod manually it says i've already downloaded it when ive only ever used this list i wonder if it was part of an older update and was put back in now


[1/16/2026 4:23 PM] stealthavenger
Got everything working a far looks great


[1/16/2026 4:24 PM] stealthavenger
Only thing is can’t seem to open up the enb settings as wanna disable dof, and I can’t see to open pipboy


[1/16/2026 4:24 PM] kazifca
numpad end I'm pre sure for enb


[1/16/2026 4:25 PM] kazifca
no clue about the pipboy, do the basics, reload, restart


[1/16/2026 4:30 PM] stealthavenger
Yeah just figuring stuff out as I’m using controller too


[1/16/2026 4:30 PM] stealthavenger
The mod pack looks so dam cool though


[1/16/2026 4:30 PM] stealthavenger
Love the animations and sound design


[1/16/2026 4:35 PM] stealthavenger
Does applying the settings in mcm remove health bars normal?


[1/16/2026 4:48 PM] kazifca

[1/16/2026 4:49 PM] stealthavenger
Seems to remove health bars off enemies too

hi


[1/16/2026 11:44 PM] zaja0479
Hello buds, had a great first save but decided to try things different. In concord and seemingly cant heal past 40% total health. What gives? My buddy having the same exact issue


[1/16/2026 11:46 PM] zaja0479
Maybe this isnt the right place to ask, on second thought


[1/16/2026 11:47 PM] kazifca
Are you bleeding?


[1/16/2026 11:49 PM] zaja0479
No. Started around concord area on a lvl 1 save. Took some damage, bled, used bandages and couldn't heal any higher than 40%


[1/16/2026 11:50 PM] zaja0479
I looked around in the discord seems @ImFiredUp26 thinks it has to do with lithium lung. Nothing else on the issue sadly

Yep


[1/16/2026 11:59 PM] kazifca
Cheat


[1/17/2026 12:06 AM] zaja0479
It didnt work on second note. But going into holotape in your pipboy and using cheat terminal portable, and heal player through one of the options fixes it. I still have lithium lung but now I can heal properly. I guess maim broke or something. Hope this helps anyone else that can't heal more than half their health

I'm going to bed before I find a puppy to kick


[1/17/2026 12:10 AM] _generalhavoc
It is possible that the time it took to put on the mask then put on the filter just after exiting the vault caused me to get radiation poisoning, if so that is some bs. There should be a message advising the use of the gas mask before leaving the vault


[1/17/2026 12:11 AM] kazifca
I've done that a couple times and didn't get sick granted I didn't leave myself irradiated, I think your gas mask not working in general is the larger issue, are you constantly under rads?


[1/17/2026 12:12 AM] kazifca
whats your IRA, you can use the radboy I think its called to get a reading


[1/17/2026 12:13 AM] _generalhavoc
I shut it down for the night. I'll start a new game and try again tomorrow.

[1/17/2026 1:27 AM] devilslayer666
Is that a bug or something cause it hasn't gone away


[1/17/2026 2:01 AM] bogansloth
whats your ira at


[1/17/2026 2:02 AM] darklary
you might have radiation poisoning. That cant be fixed with the yellow stims or booze. Gotta see a doc or drink a cleansing drink.


[1/17/2026 2:02 AM] darklary
until you do, you'll keep getting rads every so often.

in your colony you can craft an ammo workbench if you haven't try go to sanctuary and stay press v, and go to crafting


[1/17/2026 4:00 AM] garyg3
i have the workbench but i can only craft .38

hey, i wanted to ask before going thru with the 300gig install, how does the pack play like?


[1/17/2026 8:51 AM] abstract0
does it play like more like stalker gamma? or more like a realistic fallout?


[1/17/2026 8:51 AM] abstract0
or project zomboid type experience where common sense will take you far?


[1/17/2026 9:03 AM] killthemind
All the above tbh

Ghouls have grab animations that will 1 shot you so they can be spooky

Hello all 🙂


[1/17/2026 10:13 AM] nimshi89
DO I need the Script Extender to run this mod package?


[1/17/2026 10:13 AM] kazifca
yes


[1/17/2026 10:14 AM] kazifca
I  think it auto installs with wabbajack tho, maybe I'm wrong


[1/17/2026 10:14 AM] kazifca
no harm in doin it


[1/17/2026 10:16 AM] nimshi89
thanks mate 🙂


[1/17/2026 10:17 AM] nimshi89
yeah first time modding so....wish me luck


[1/17/2026 10:17 AM] nimshi89
Also, just in case if I would only use vortex would that work?


[1/17/2026 10:19 AM] kazifca
No, and you should switch over to MO2, most mods have guidelines about placement, and theres a ton of guides kicking around that provides frame works. You also don't risk LOOT cooking your LO at 600 mods and ruining your saves


[1/17/2026 10:20 AM] nimshi89
okay I just installed that well I am unsure about where I got the modlist cause I installed it to the wabbajack folder so like C/wabbajack/download/modlist/anomaly and I hope that will still work


[1/17/2026 10:22 AM] kazifca
As long as you installed wabbajack properly, you can get away with letting it do its thing and create it's directories.


[1/17/2026 10:22 AM] kazifca
It'll install and set up the modpack for you in MO2


[1/17/2026 10:23 AM] nimshi89
thanks, sorry I know this is a general chat but I dont have access to the helping ones 😄


[1/17/2026 10:29 AM] shaggyrogers0420
is Shift-enter for the enb menu? Cause it doesnt open for me


[1/17/2026 10:55 AM] devilslayer666
Am I gonna get radiation poison after eating anything or no?


[1/17/2026 10:57 AM] darklary
Rad poisoning usually only occurs at 2 of those green bars worth of rads. The green bars in question appear in the bottom left of your screen by default. Just above the little man that tells you how your body is doing. You can also check your rad levels with the rad boy device in "aid" under "Devices".


[1/17/2026 11:02 AM] devilslayer666
Alright I seen those green bars and keep my eyes on them


[1/17/2026 11:04 AM] darklary
Mutaway, and the CA yellow stims remove IRA, but if you actually get rad poisoning, you'll need either a doctor or cleansing drink. But as far as I've seen, only doctors sell those drinks and they're like 800 caps. Where paying for treatment is 300.


[1/17/2026 11:18 AM] devilslayer666
Mutaway? Lol


[1/17/2026 11:18 AM] devilslayer666
I can't wait to see the guns added in this mod


[1/17/2026 11:18 AM] devilslayer666
Also I bought one of those drinks from a merchant


[1/17/2026 11:24 AM] darklary
good, those are the only way to cure rad poisoning in the field. Make sure you get your rads down BEFORE drinking it though.


[1/17/2026 11:28 AM] kazifca
sorry, got myself detained for an hour sharing a link to a discord, It's chill, stick away  from adding script heavy mods, you can and should ask questions about anomaly in here, report any bugs or weirdness going on, but for more generalized modding questions, I'll send you a link for a discord with more generalized modding resources

Pretty nooby question I'm sure, but how do I treat Lithium Lung, Weakened Muscles, etc?  Is that all just symptoms of radiation poisoning?

Thats rad poisoning you need a doctor to clear rads. OR, a cleansing drink. Doctors sell them but they're pretty expensive for early on.


[1/17/2026 12:25 PM] rspackmeister
Alright,  thanks.  Still in Concord but I've saved up around 1400 caps.  Just gotta find a doctor


[1/17/2026 12:26 PM] darklary
Yeah, you gotta head to diamond city. Sorry man, I was in the same boat at one point though. Could get lucky and bump into a traveling doctor.


[1/17/2026 12:26 PM] darklary
Or vault 81


[1/17/2026 12:26 PM] darklary
OH WAIT, I almost forgot about covenant


[1/17/2026 12:28 PM] nimshi89
Okay silly question but how to enter VATS?


[1/17/2026 12:32 PM] nimshi89
BTW thjis mod is beyond insane


[1/17/2026 12:32 PM] nimshi89
I died like 20 times and I love it


[1/17/2026 12:32 PM] darklary
Vats is replaced with VAFS


[1/17/2026 12:32 PM] darklary
which is just bullet time slow down that allows you to aim better and move in, frankly, crazy non-sensical ways and I love it.


[1/17/2026 12:32 PM] darklary
The button is G

[1/17/2026 12:33 PM] nimshi89
thank you mate 🙂


[1/17/2026 12:33 PM] darklary
Also 1400 already? Dang nice, try and save for 2k before you go to bunker hill. You'll thank me.


[1/17/2026 12:55 PM] shaggyrogers0420
um how do I run power in my settlment? I cant connect wires at all


[1/17/2026 1:06 PM] nimshi89
Im at the beginning of the game and I was about to get in the power armor and it says I need training. How am I supposed to get training so early?


[1/17/2026 1:10 PM] darklary
Ok, so idk if that's a bug you're dealing with. In your settlement construction mode, look at a power source or connector and hit space bar to start wiring?


[1/17/2026 1:11 PM] darklary
You should just be able to look, hit space, run it a certain distance and hit space again to connect it to the thing you're trying to power to connect it.


[1/17/2026 1:11 PM] shaggyrogers0420
I restarted my game just now cause I think I was having mutliple bugs.


[1/17/2026 1:12 PM] darklary
Well, there's a cassette on the desk near the power armor in question. Pick that up and make sure to read the pop-up

{Reactions}
❤️

[1/17/2026 1:14 PM] darklary
It'll tell you where you can go to get power armor training.


[1/17/2026 1:42 PM] nimshi89
I swear im not stupid but there was no pop-up so based on the Holo I guess I should take off somewhere. But then I'll get shot down as I leave the building


[1/17/2026 1:53 PM] shaggyrogers0420
Is there a website or reddit post with all the skills or a build planner? There is just so much new stuff im having trouble planning lol


[1/17/2026 1:55 PM] nimshi89
Found it


[1/17/2026 2:01 PM] darklary
Nice


[1/17/2026 2:08 PM] nimshi89
Bunker Hill is so far


[1/17/2026 2:08 PM] nimshi89
How on earth am I supposed to get there? 🤣


[1/17/2026 2:08 PM] nimshi89
So the minuteman will just wait here for a few months? 🤣


[1/17/2026 2:09 PM] darklary
they will have to, lol.


[1/17/2026 2:10 PM] darklary
Same way I did. By walkin my incredibly two shottable ass into boston.

[1/17/2026 2:11 PM] nimshi89
Of i go on an adventure


[1/17/2026 2:11 PM] darklary
I too considering tripping and rolling down a hill an adventure. WHo knows where I'll end up?


[1/17/2026 2:16 PM] nimshi89
Grave? 🥹


[1/17/2026 2:26 PM] darklary
Nah, I'm brave.


[1/17/2026 2:53 PM] _generalhavoc
I particularly enjoy the interaction where falling down means I am now swimming under the map. Very immersive.


[1/17/2026 3:38 PM] grimaldus1820
Good day, gentlemen

[1/17/2026 4:03 PM] .robo_
the stumbling with weak muscles effect is cute but holy shit is it buggy. Why is this in the game? I've rag dolled through the map several times already


[1/17/2026 4:13 PM] caughtmedead
Is there a resource for handy key binds for the mod pack? I noticed a YouTuber was able to check his armor plates and replace it with a keybind. I’m looking for similar things, or is there somewhere in the mcm that I can see all active keybinds?


[1/17/2026 4:18 PM] .robo_
h for hot wheel, y for armor plates. check the readme for more keybinds


[1/17/2026 4:43 PM] dallas9911
what mod does the follower fade in and out?


[1/17/2026 6:48 PM] devilslayer666
The green bar that shows my radiation is gone?


[1/17/2026 6:49 PM] devilslayer666
Did I some how turn it off?


[1/17/2026 6:57 PM] devilslayer666
Oh nevermind there it is lol


[1/17/2026 8:10 PM] dracolayer
so, i started a new game after the most recent update. i forget, how do i get gud lol. i know scopes really help, but any other advise. im trying to clear concord.


[1/17/2026 8:23 PM] devilslayer666
OK how do I skin animals and monsters?


[1/17/2026 8:31 PM] darklary
You need a knife. Like a combat knife or something.


[1/17/2026 8:31 PM] devilslayer666
I have one but he's not doing anything


[1/17/2026 8:31 PM] devilslayer666
Bowie knife


[1/17/2026 8:44 PM] devilslayer666
That's I was level 8 but when I hit 9 I didn't level up?


[1/17/2026 8:47 PM] devilslayer666
Oh wait nevermind


[1/17/2026 8:55 PM] devilslayer666
Wait I'm not leveling up anymore


[1/17/2026 9:01 PM] darklary
Are you pressing O?


[1/17/2026 9:04 PM] devilslayer666
Nooo? What you mean?


[1/17/2026 9:07 PM] devilslayer666
Now I'm 10 but I still didn't level up?


[1/17/2026 9:09 PM] devilslayer666
Yea I'm not leveling up anymore what's going on?


[1/17/2026 9:11 PM] darklary
sorry, that was in regard to the skinning animals thing.


[1/17/2026 9:11 PM] darklary
As for not leveling up, I can look around


[1/17/2026 9:12 PM] devilslayer666
Oh thanks for that heh


[1/17/2026 9:12 PM] darklary
They changed the button to harvest from f to o this most recent update.


[1/17/2026 9:13 PM] darklary
Please describe exactly how the level ups aren't working. Your experience bar fills up, you open the level up screen and?


[1/17/2026 9:15 PM] _bighoss
.


[1/17/2026 9:16 PM] _bighoss
Uhhh which preset is the hardest


[1/17/2026 9:20 PM] devilslayer666
It goes up and then went to level 10 from 9 but I wasnt given the ability to level up and select perks and abilities


[1/17/2026 9:21 PM] devilslayer666
Wasn't sorry


[1/17/2026 9:23 PM] darklary
and you've quickly ensured you are ready to level up? Like just quickly picked a lock or something?


[1/17/2026 9:26 PM] devilslayer666
Killed some things, and locked picked till the bar went to the max and I hit level 10. But I wasn't given the option to level up


[1/17/2026 9:27 PM] devilslayer666
I'm unsure what's happening


[1/17/2026 9:27 PM] darklary
when you open the skill window you can't pick your stuff?


[1/17/2026 9:27 PM] devilslayer666
Nope, not a perk or skills.


[1/17/2026 9:27 PM] darklary
is it showing a full bar and level 9? Or level 10 and you just got nothing for leveling up?


[1/17/2026 9:28 PM] devilslayer666
It opens up bit I have no points to spend when I went up to 10


[1/17/2026 9:28 PM] darklary
I'm gonna test something


[1/17/2026 9:30 PM] devilslayer666
Wait if you try to advance your character level will that mess up you character leveling up?


[1/17/2026 9:30 PM] darklary
oh with console commands?


[1/17/2026 9:31 PM] darklary
I do believe that will mess it up, yeah.


[1/17/2026 9:33 PM] perinthia
What the hell is this settlement trying to power? Liberty prime?

My favorite part is that it's not enough power


[1/17/2026 9:33 PM] darklary
for WHATEVER it is


[1/17/2026 9:34 PM] perinthia
iv run out of resources to build fuision generators, so i need to go out and try and get more lol


[1/17/2026 9:34 PM] devilslayer666
Oooh alright, although nothing happened I guess it messed it up. Now I either probably have to start over or go back to a early save


[1/17/2026 9:34 PM] devilslayer666
Wanted to see if a perk was worth it


[1/17/2026 9:35 PM] devilslayer666
Well that sucks


[1/17/2026 9:35 PM] darklary
bummer, sorry to hear that bud.


[1/17/2026 9:36 PM] perinthia
are you not able to just go to a save before when you did it?


[1/17/2026 9:37 PM] devilslayer666
I could yes, but Iose 4 hours of in game progress and loot


[1/17/2026 9:37 PM] perinthia
that sounds better than starting over completely


[1/17/2026 9:39 PM] devilslayer666
Yea I know but the loot I got was pretty good too


[1/17/2026 9:39 PM] devilslayer666
I'll have to see


[1/17/2026 9:52 PM] devilslayer666
Btw can I somehow make the 45 pistol hit harder? I feel like it's damaged is low as hell


[1/17/2026 10:20 PM] _bighoss
My FPS got nuked from max fps to unplayable because I restarted the game????


[1/17/2026 10:21 PM] _bighoss
is that normal


[1/17/2026 10:22 PM] perinthia
this gentleman is not apart of my settlement nor can i even recruit him, he has also decided that the bar i just made is the perfect location for him to stay. he has not moved from that location for 2 ingame days. he has officially stolen my bar from me and my settlers 😄

[1/17/2026 10:25 PM] darklary
A mix of leveling handguns and workbench upgrades ought to help. And Zynn.


[1/17/2026 10:26 PM] _bighoss
how can a game go from running perfectly to abysmall just by relaunching the application?


[1/17/2026 10:29 PM] bogansloth
is there a perk or way to detect landmines they seem to be literally invisible until its too late


[1/17/2026 10:33 PM] kazifca
Look in stealth for the perk that makes it so you don't set them off while sneaking


[1/17/2026 10:37 PM] devilslayer666
To answer everyone's question yes I did have to load back and now I'm leveling up normally again lol


[1/17/2026 10:38 PM] perinthia
wearing power armor feels great until an enemy whips out the shoulder mounted M2  and just 1 shots you through your armor


[1/17/2026 10:38 PM] kazifca
Have, you seen a 20mm bullet?


[1/17/2026 10:40 PM] perinthia
oh i didnt say it doesnt make sense, just a bit surprising when you go from invicible, to dead


[1/17/2026 10:40 PM] kazifca
Fair enough


[1/17/2026 10:40 PM] kazifca
Yeah it is jaunting for sure


[1/17/2026 10:40 PM] kazifca
Reminds you that things can infact still take you out


[1/17/2026 10:41 PM] kazifca
I want more LMGs in the kinda for that reason


[1/17/2026 10:41 PM] bogansloth
feels good from the other end of the encounter


[1/17/2026 10:41 PM] bogansloth
when you pull out a shoulder mounted and blow away the raider and his fatman


[1/17/2026 10:42 PM] kazifca
Ya'll carry around the m2:8276_Cool_Finger_Guns:


[1/17/2026 10:42 PM] kazifca
Respect


[1/17/2026 10:42 PM] bogansloth
who tf decided a power armor raider in lexington with a fatman anyway


[1/17/2026 10:42 PM] kazifca
This is vanilla


[1/17/2026 10:42 PM] perinthia
this is currently what i use in power armor, but iv only ever seen 1 so idk if its even in the level list, or just in the 1 location i found it

i lugged around 2 at one point


[1/17/2026 10:43 PM] bogansloth
piper needed one because bitches love cannons


[1/17/2026 10:43 PM] kazifca
That's a unique a think


[1/17/2026 10:43 PM] kazifca
M2s are def in the list


[1/17/2026 10:43 PM] kazifca
Ball knowledge required


[1/17/2026 10:43 PM] perinthia
yeah gunners love the M2s


[1/17/2026 10:44 PM] bogansloth
gunners chase me with gauss rifles


[1/17/2026 10:44 PM] kazifca
Get her a police outfit too :FancyPepe:


[1/17/2026 10:44 PM] bogansloth

[1/17/2026 10:44 PM] chalkeraser
or no i changed my fov and its super small now


[1/17/2026 10:44 PM] kazifca
Probably in the FALLUI series


[1/17/2026 10:45 PM] kazifca
look for 'scale' altering icons


[1/17/2026 10:45 PM] bogansloth
im going into automatron to make my own party


[1/17/2026 10:45 PM] kazifca

[1/17/2026 10:45 PM] chalkeraser

[1/17/2026 10:45 PM] perinthia

[1/17/2026 10:45 PM] bogansloth
press mod config


[1/17/2026 10:45 PM] bogansloth

[1/17/2026 10:49 PM] kazifca
OP because of the effect, because the effect is strong on humans


[1/17/2026 10:49 PM] kazifca
but otherwise, and probably not OP


[1/17/2026 10:49 PM] kazifca
that damage is REALLY low


[1/17/2026 10:49 PM] kazifca
Like, oddly low


[1/17/2026 10:49 PM] bogansloth
can we talk about how a grenade works through 3 walls but a bullet doesn't pierce the gap in a picket fence


[1/17/2026 10:50 PM] kazifca
We can, you try getting bullet penetration framework to be compatible with everything :FancyPepe:


[1/17/2026 10:50 PM] kazifca
I'm joking


[1/17/2026 10:50 PM] kazifca
But it's a difficult mod to get to agree


[1/17/2026 10:50 PM] bogansloth
i swear the npcs pierce everything with their bullets tho


[1/17/2026 10:51 PM] bogansloth
me my allys

god himself


[1/17/2026 10:51 PM] kazifca

[1/17/2026 10:51 PM] kazifca
cause I don't really think theres any serious AI mods


[1/17/2026 10:51 PM] perinthia
i just assume that if i see the grenade warning prompt, im dead.


[1/17/2026 10:51 PM] bogansloth
me too


[1/17/2026 10:51 PM] bogansloth
just sucks when its a grenade a threw through a window into a concrete building or sthn


[1/17/2026 10:52 PM] bogansloth
whats the subway mod called again for the manholes


[1/17/2026 10:52 PM] bogansloth

[1/17/2026 10:52 PM] perinthia
i had to give heather the smart grenade, since she would always kill me with normal ones


[1/17/2026 10:52 PM] kazifca
Abandoned Tunnels


[1/17/2026 10:52 PM] kazifca
Do NOT give heather grenades


[1/17/2026 10:52 PM] kazifca
I repeat that woman is mf insane


[1/17/2026 10:53 PM] perinthia
the smart grenades atleast cannot hurt me or any friendlies, regardless of how hard she tries


[1/17/2026 10:53 PM] perinthia
i saw someone give her nuka grenades and that was a sight to see


[1/17/2026 10:53 PM] kazifca
Yeah, bro probably reloaded the same sequence five times to get the clip


[1/17/2026 10:53 PM] bogansloth
rip the mod page doesnt have a manhole map


[1/17/2026 10:54 PM] kazifca
Where are you


[1/17/2026 10:54 PM] perinthia
which one are you looking for? i haev most uncovered


[1/17/2026 10:54 PM] bogansloth
closest one to wattz consumer

yeah thats pretty close


[1/17/2026 10:56 PM] bogansloth
wont let me send images


[1/17/2026 10:56 PM] perinthia

[1/17/2026 10:56 PM] perinthia
sorry east


[1/17/2026 10:57 PM] bogansloth
i was about to say


[1/17/2026 10:58 PM] perinthia
this modlist seems alot more difficult than the last time i played it, im currently lvl 57 and havent even found out how to get into the institute yet


[1/17/2026 10:58 PM] perinthia
going to be level 200 by the time i finish at this rate


[1/17/2026 10:58 PM] kazifca
This is your first run through?


[1/17/2026 10:58 PM] bogansloth
yep


[1/17/2026 10:59 PM] bogansloth
im a clueless idiot and im getting my shit utterly pushed in


[1/17/2026 10:59 PM] perinthia
nah iv beat fallout a few times, and once on a previous run on anomaly


[1/17/2026 10:59 PM] bogansloth
10/10 would reccomend


[1/17/2026 10:59 PM] kazifca
You'll get used to it, I generally run willingly into late game areas around level 25 once I got the hang of it


[1/17/2026 10:59 PM] kazifca
what you will probably never run towards, is super mutants with missle launchers


[1/17/2026 10:59 PM] bogansloth
i come from gamma mod


[1/17/2026 11:00 PM] perinthia
who are you siding with sloth?


[1/17/2026 11:00 PM] bogansloth
this is par for the course


[1/17/2026 11:00 PM] kazifca
they always push your shit in


[1/17/2026 11:00 PM] bogansloth
so far im just tryna get to automatron


[1/17/2026 11:00 PM] perinthia
oh have fun with that haha, i usually save that dlc for later


[1/17/2026 11:01 PM] perinthia

We need merchants before robots :FancyPepe:


[1/17/2026 11:01 PM] bogansloth
1 sec i got a quote for why this dlc is my priority


[1/17/2026 11:02 PM] bogansloth
Hey look buddy, I'm an engineer. That means I solve problems, not problems like "What is beauty?" Because that would fall within the purview of your conundrums of philosophy. I solve practical problems, for instance: how am I going to stop some mean mother Hubbard from tearing me a structurally superfluous be-hind? The answer, use a gun, and if that don't work... Use more gun. Take for instance this heavy caliber tripod mounted lil' old number designed by me, built by me, and you best hope... Not pointed at you

i added sim settlements 2, and im surprised how smooth it is and the lack of conflicts, im assuming it wasnt put in since it does make some things a bit easier, i just dont wanna have to build most the settlements my self, and the questline is enjoyable


[1/17/2026 11:03 PM] bogansloth

[1/17/2026 11:52 PM] kazifca
It gives you an actual save


[1/17/2026 11:52 PM] kazifca
Smoking cigarettes give you an auto save


[1/17/2026 11:53 PM] bogansloth

[1/17/2026 11:54 PM] kazifca
You should be able to make them somewhere


[1/17/2026 11:54 PM] kazifca
They should be in aid, if not, they’re tagged wrong


[1/17/2026 11:54 PM] bogansloth

[1/17/2026 11:57 PM] devilslayer666
If I want to change the weather to make it clear will it mess up the game? I'm not gonna deal with a storm that last for 5 days

[1/18/2026 12:04 AM] bogansloth

[1/18/2026 12:09 AM] perinthia
i have an explosive SMG and its great for killing everything, including myself


[1/18/2026 12:09 AM] bogansloth
maybe the drum mag fire shotguns my better choice XD


[1/18/2026 12:09 AM] kazifca

[1/18/2026 12:43 AM] darklary
I had no idea there was leaning. This changes everything.

in Mod organizer, you can type the mod name: Uneducated shooter, and find it to turn it on. In game go into mcm and select the mod from the list, and bind lean keys.


[1/18/2026 1:09 AM] hundamien

[1/18/2026 1:37 AM] darklary
MAIM is in the mcm. Under combat.

[1/18/2026 1:43 AM] chalkeraser
hey it wont let me use the power armor says i dont know how to use the armor what do i do aout the quest


[1/18/2026 1:43 AM] perinthia
brotherhood will train you when you get on the prydwyn


[1/18/2026 1:44 AM] perinthia
if your talking about hte museum of freedom quest, you gotta do it without the armor


[1/18/2026 1:46 AM] darklary
There's a way to learn power armor training. You just don't start with it now. There's a holotape in the vertibird that'll give you a lead with a pop up after you pick it up.


[1/18/2026 2:09 AM] jeandenaoded
Hey iam at the beginning of the game and i play with a 10mm handgun, i was thinking that this modpack make enemy really dangerous but i was hoping that i was too, is it normal that i need like 3 or 4 headshot for killing a raider ?


[1/18/2026 2:34 AM] .robo_

[1/18/2026 2:37 AM] bogansloth

is building a settlement worth the investment long term in anomaly?


[1/18/2026 3:53 AM] caughtmedead

Why does my gas mask not seem to work? I keep getting irradiated even though I am taking care of the IRA, RADS, ETC. Every time I get my IRA back down to 0 it just keeps going up again, I notice when my geiger counter is going off my filter isn't going down, is this a known bug?


[1/18/2026 8:42 AM] rud87
Does this modlist work with f4 GOTY from epic games ?


[1/18/2026 8:44 AM] kazifca

[1/18/2026 9:22 AM] kazifca
It's hunter of the commonwealth


[1/18/2026 9:22 AM] kazifca
You're in the clear just bring a knife and butcher some people, look for the hotkey


[1/18/2026 9:24 AM] rockitao
you're right
I was using search for keywords on discord on how to disassemble stuff, and someone mentioned that here, probably wrong info


[1/18/2026 9:25 AM] rockitao
how do I get rid of the vehicles in settlements?  it can't be scrapped so I thought there was a mechanic for disassembling these with a tool


[1/18/2026 9:25 AM] kazifca
shoot it


[1/18/2026 9:26 AM] rockitao
lol I might do  that. I'll ring the bell for settlers to get out of the way and explode everything


[1/18/2026 9:26 AM] kazifca
Naw, just giver


[1/18/2026 9:26 AM] kazifca

[1/18/2026 9:28 AM] kazifca
I don't think you shot them


[1/18/2026 9:28 AM] kazifca
Pretty sure you shot the car


[1/18/2026 9:39 AM] simmic1945
Anyone know why putting on the gasmask in the modpack makes everything super dark? its impossible to see with it on


[1/18/2026 9:41 AM] kazifca
MCM -> Gameplay or immersion idk -> Damn Apocalypse -> Radiation Module -> last setting in the right side of the screen - OFF


[1/18/2026 9:42 AM] simmic1945
Thank you

Hey does installing this modlists keep f4 installation isolated so I can install other modlists as well ?


[1/18/2026 9:53 AM] kazifca
It keeps the modlist installation isolated, you'll probably have to put in extra effort to make sure the installation itself is isolated


[1/18/2026 9:54 AM] kazifca
theres a tool for that kicking around, still don't remember its name though


[1/18/2026 9:54 AM] kazifca

I notice that my gas mask filter icon in the top left has stopped flashing colors, it used to flash green or red, and I noticed my filter hasn’t gone down at all in the past couple in game days, is it possible my mod is broken?


[1/18/2026 10:40 AM] garyg3
Ok so I'm almost level 25 and I have some halfway decent armor but I'm still get one shot ALOT am I missing something should I use the main head armor modifier on all armor pieces or just the helmet or not at all? I love not being a super tank but the rng of a gun fight isn't so fun when I'm holding my own then some dude a mile away gets a instant headshot and I'm dead. Or they spray bullets and I drop.


[1/18/2026 10:48 AM] garyg3
And damn piper and Heather don't shoot shit I've watched raiders walk right past them


[1/18/2026 10:49 AM] darklary
Yeah they're really discerning with when they use ammo.


[1/18/2026 10:49 AM] darklary
Even though, as npcs, they have infinite ammo.


[1/18/2026 11:18 AM] .robo_
Exposure compounds, you were likely already irradiated. Also for some reason some gas masks have much lower rad resistance than others. I have no idea why some models have 50 while others have 800.


[1/18/2026 11:19 AM] .robo_
Use the radboy to check, it will tell you if you need medical attention

Also make sure you have a fresh filter in, and the mask isn't broken.

how do I get followers to equip and wear gas masks during rad storms like random npcs?


[1/18/2026 11:29 AM] perinthia
Manually going into their inventory and pressing equip

well they seem to be terminators now lmao and i didnt do a thing tho backpacks are bugged to hell they wont stay equiped and when they randomly let me equip them they unequip at random and bug out again


[1/18/2026 12:09 PM] perinthia
Weird, iv never had any issues with thr backpacks


[1/18/2026 1:04 PM] rud87
Is it possible to change the prompt font color like "take" or "open" because it doesnt match the HUD color


[1/18/2026 1:14 PM] nimshi89
okay how is it that the radiation device says Safe but if I take my mask off my rads sckyrocket?


[1/18/2026 1:14 PM] nimshi89
I am inside a house not in the rain


[1/18/2026 1:17 PM] .robo_
it is relative to you, so it's saying with the mask on you are safe, pretty sure


[1/18/2026 1:17 PM] .robo_
if you take the mask off and get another reading it will say radiation exposure


[1/18/2026 1:17 PM] .robo_
and if not its because you're irradiated


[1/18/2026 1:18 PM] .robo_
it was a little weird before I got used to it, but havent seen an issue in 20 hours or so


[1/18/2026 1:19 PM] perinthia
if you accidentally kill a brotherhood squad will the entire faction turn hostile? (and would it fail all their quests if they did turn hostile?)


[1/18/2026 2:12 PM] caughtmedead
I notice that my gas mask filter icon in the top left has stopped flashing colors, it used to flash green or red, and I noticed my filter hasn’t gone down at all in the past couple in game days, is it possible my mod is broken?


[1/18/2026 2:24 PM] perinthia
anyone know why this immortal mole rat wont stop attacking me?

Is the cigarette animation-less? it's just replicating the stimpak animation


[1/18/2026 3:00 PM] caughtmedead
Same I got it to play the cigarette smoke animation once


[1/18/2026 3:01 PM] caughtmedead
Is there a way to reinitialize mods or something? Should I turn it off, load the game, exit and turn it back on or will this break the save?


[1/18/2026 3:01 PM] tirasangue
hmmm, do I download an animation mod? any idea how to fix it?


[1/18/2026 3:05 PM] caughtmedead
Not sure it Randomly played the animation for me just one time, I’m not exactly sure what made it play, been trying to replicate it since then


[1/18/2026 3:06 PM] caughtmedead
So the animation is there, just being conflicted maybe


[1/18/2026 3:31 PM] rud87
hey which mod handles the interact element of the UI  ?


[1/18/2026 3:46 PM] bellusci
Guys, got this weird bug where preston simply won't move, only if I send him to move, ootherwise he just stays put... Did the console "ressurect" command and it didnt solve the problem, could be mod related


[1/18/2026 4:01 PM] rud87
I cant solve this mouse sensitivity mismatch with horizontal/vertical sensitivity


[1/18/2026 4:02 PM] rud87
I looked all the previous chats and although my settings are set as suggested it wont reflect in-game


[1/18/2026 4:02 PM] rud87
bethini also confirms that x=y it doesn't work


[1/18/2026 4:13 PM] rud87
apparently you have to add this in fallout4.ini 
fPitchSpeedRatio=1.0000 under CONTROLS


[1/18/2026 4:15 PM] caughtmedead
Does the gas mask filter only go down in radiation storms? does it have no bearing on regular radiation in the game world?


[1/18/2026 4:20 PM] dallas9911
Anti rad drugs dont do anything llike How many radaway do i need to take to clear the rads


[1/18/2026 4:41 PM] darklary
correct. Only during rad storms or in rads does the filter degrade. However, the mask can get broken in combat so it's still not good to always be wearing it.


[1/18/2026 4:41 PM] darklary
Do you just have rads, or do you also have rad POISONING?


[1/18/2026 4:42 PM] darklary
if you have actual radiation poisoning, you'll need to see a doctor, or buy a cleansing drink to clear it. But using a doc is 500 caps cheaper.


[1/18/2026 4:42 PM] rud87
theres 2 gas masks in the vault at the begining and the one you find on the ground at the exit has like 750 rad protection as opposed to 50 on m1a211


[1/18/2026 4:43 PM] rud87
just making sure something messed up not providing me op items


[1/18/2026 4:44 PM] dallas9911
I cleared the rads now im just to broke to afford a DR to clear the other


[1/18/2026 4:47 PM] caughtmedead
I think my game is seriously borked; I noticed that my Rad-boy has stopped talking as well, usually it gives the radiation ingestion updates


[1/18/2026 4:51 PM] rockitao
bunch of robots attacked my settlement  and destroyed crops, it says it requires Seeds to repair it, I can't scrap these either.. how do  I get these seeds "[Other] Seeds - Tato"?


[1/18/2026 4:57 PM] rud87
yeah its just chop outside


[1/18/2026 4:58 PM] rud87
not so bad for roleplaying but horrible for gunplay indeed


[1/18/2026 4:59 PM] perinthia
apparently the BOS have tamed ferals, they arent attacking eachother and are just watching something in the distance

[1/18/2026 5:04 PM] rud87
we use gasmasks all the time like in Frost ?


[1/18/2026 5:11 PM] darklary
not ALL the time? Your watch will beep when you need one.


[1/18/2026 5:13 PM] caughtmedead
Gonna try a clean install, seems like I fked my game somehow, just making sure but if any of the mods fail to download the install will fail too right? It won't just install normally without throwing an error I can clearly see?


[1/18/2026 5:15 PM] darklary
if you can't install or download a mod, I do believe it halts the process and tells you.


[1/18/2026 5:35 PM] caughtmedead
Awesome, I assume somewhere along the lines there was some sort of user error in my problems hahaha so hopefully re-doing everything will be g


[1/18/2026 5:50 PM] naggoob
Hi, wondered if I could ask a question. ON the webpage for this mod it says it is still in beta and advices to wait for release. Is there an approximate time until it will be released?


[1/18/2026 6:43 PM] bellusci
By the way I found the solution, a settler was trying to interact with him and he got stuck, I teleported preston to me and eventually the settler reached him and finished the interaction, really annoying

{Reactions}
💯

[1/18/2026 6:54 PM] rud87
Im stuck inside the APC van near Red Rocket


[1/18/2026 6:54 PM] rud87
I somehow tleported inside without finding a key


[1/18/2026 6:54 PM] rud87
and Now I'm inside and dogmeat is fighting some scav outside


[1/18/2026 6:54 PM] rud87
any tips ?


[1/18/2026 6:57 PM] darklary
there should be a button to the right of the door on the wall to open it.


[1/18/2026 7:00 PM] rud87
yeah couldnt find it just tcl my way out


[1/18/2026 7:12 PM] bootineye
Earlier I found a old western revolver but died before I could save. Is it a random spawn or is it like a unique gun where a boss drops it? I know it's a modded gun.


[1/18/2026 7:16 PM] kazifca
Western revolver is Nuka DLC


[1/18/2026 7:16 PM] kazifca
Random probably


[1/18/2026 7:16 PM] rud87
damn this lossless scaling tool impressive


[1/18/2026 7:22 PM] bootineye
wait really? I never seen it before haha

[1/18/2026 7:32 PM] devilslayer666
Is there a way to turn thr flashlight on the gun?


[1/18/2026 7:39 PM] simmic1945
What mod do i need to disable to be able to save normally?


[1/18/2026 8:08 PM] rud87
Does cold prevent healing ?


[1/18/2026 8:49 PM] naggoob
Would you guys say it's okey to play the Anomaly modlist now or should I wait for the final release? And if so, anyone know when that release will be?


[1/18/2026 8:52 PM] kazifca
Play it


[1/18/2026 8:52 PM] naggoob
👍


[1/18/2026 8:52 PM] kazifca
It's more so being maintained at the moment than developed


[1/18/2026 9:01 PM] adrelala
what skill and level do i need to be able to scrap ammo? the only ammo i can disassemble to get gunpowder is .38


[1/18/2026 9:01 PM] kazifca
You need to learn ammo recipes at the engineering bench


[1/18/2026 9:01 PM] adrelala
ah the recipe that is crafted with 100 of the ammo? well that's a catch 22


[1/18/2026 9:02 PM] kazifca
Yep


[1/18/2026 9:02 PM] adrelala
need 100 of the ammo to craft but i need to find 100 of hte ammo in the first place to even craft it


[1/18/2026 9:02 PM] kazifca
Scrounger goes br


[1/18/2026 9:02 PM] adrelala

[1/18/2026 9:02 PM] kazifca
Naw


[1/18/2026 9:02 PM] kazifca
just grab a level or two of it


[1/18/2026 9:02 PM] kazifca
It'll make a major diff


[1/18/2026 9:02 PM] kazifca
just need lockpicking


[1/18/2026 9:03 PM] kazifca
Or, the alternative is use less ammo :FancyPepe:


[1/18/2026 9:03 PM] adrelala
alternative using less ammo means ill die in melee combat to anything


[1/18/2026 9:04 PM] adrelala
maim literally gives me light bleed and fractured leg in 2 hits


[1/18/2026 9:04 PM] bootineye
So there's western revolver which that one I remember. But there was one I saw called old western revolver. Looked like the navy revolver from RDR2


[1/18/2026 9:04 PM] adrelala

[1/18/2026 9:04 PM] adrelala

You got leadbelly?


[1/19/2026 2:53 AM] jeandenaoded
no just parasite, my effect screen is full of different sickness xd maybe there are a guide about that ?

[1/19/2026 5:13 AM] daninjah
it does and it looks very cool, but doesn't work in 3rd person for some reason


[1/19/2026 5:14 AM] daninjah
will the hotkey changes be saved on wabbajack update or overwritten? i play on 36-key kb so changed quite a lot

is there a way I can remove it from the levelled lists?


[1/19/2026 5:30 AM] daninjah

Are Q and E suppose to be bound to something? Like lean or some such?

Ill try to see if I can fix those this week:Cool_Finger_Guns_Crying:

also whats the point of having an APC van mod if it doesn't shelter from rain and cold


[1/19/2026 6:42 AM] streikeizer
I got no clue. Can you look in the pipboy to see if you really got nothing. Keep in mind im just keeping it up to date if I can.


[1/19/2026 6:42 AM] rud87

Aight. Well I got no clue. Sorry if it doesnt work.


[1/19/2026 6:51 AM] streikeizer
Only thing I can say is reapply the mcm and wait 72 hours.


[1/19/2026 6:53 AM] rud87
I did and it changed nothing


[1/19/2026 6:53 AM] rud87
only to reset my keybindings and such

[1/19/2026 6:56 AM] rud87
yeah thats because this modlist doesn't work as intended and no1 knows why


[1/19/2026 6:57 AM] rud87
Ive given a good 10 hours into this actively to make it work search through discord use console commands reset make a new save/toon reinstall from scratch


[1/19/2026 6:57 AM] rud87
it's the modlist not you


[1/19/2026 7:35 AM] chimeraxzc
is there any food that doesnt give you internal rad poisoning?


[1/19/2026 7:41 AM] naggoob
has anybody had it so the smoking animation for example has changed to the character jabbing himself with a syringe instead?


[1/19/2026 7:53 AM] daninjah
a lot of cooked stuff and produce bench too. cooking is OP tbh, baked tato is rad-free and gives health, same with juices


[1/19/2026 7:53 AM] daninjah
besides, IRA goes down after a bit, just don't binge on raw radroaches


[1/19/2026 7:53 AM] chimeraxzc
i have been eating baked tato, i have 100 of them, but i get poisoned either way


[1/19/2026 7:53 AM] chimeraxzc
and only pure water


[1/19/2026 7:54 AM] daninjah
you can get it just for having too much rads too. two and a half green rad tabs already have a probability, and the higher the more probable it is


[1/19/2026 7:55 AM] chimeraxzc
external rads affect the internal too? because the message says that i injested rads


[1/19/2026 7:55 AM] daninjah
external rads seep into your body or summat like that i guess. so you need to jab radaways or drink booze


[1/19/2026 7:56 AM] streikeizer
@Rud can you dm ne your save file maybe I can find the issue that way


[1/19/2026 7:56 AM] daninjah
yeah, you have to keep them down too because when you're poisoned it's too late for jabs. took me forever to shamble down to diamond city, stuck in the textures several times thanks to mister rubber knees


[1/19/2026 7:56 AM] streikeizer
Yeah already noted and fixed on my end


[1/19/2026 7:57 AM] chimeraxzc
alright, thank you brother


[1/19/2026 8:00 AM] daninjah
yeah it's enough to forget change a gasmask filter one time and get a nuclear diarrhea, i love it tbh, but it gets too easy once you open ancient tunnels and diamond city. like you can always run to the doctor from anywhere. might try and disable the tunnels for my next playthrough, but not sure it won't break stuff


[1/19/2026 8:01 AM] chimeraxzc
yeah, kind of annoying that you get only 1 second to change the filter because you get +99999 rads per second when it runs out


[1/19/2026 8:02 AM] naggoob
@Overseer StreikEizer excuse me if I can. Is there anyway to modify keysetting? my Q and E key seems unused. Are they suppose to have some action?


[1/19/2026 8:03 AM] daninjah
most of the keys can be changed in the mod settings - User Interface - Hotkeys. q and e are unused and i rebinded them myself


[1/19/2026 8:05 AM] daninjah
q for VAFS and e for Wheel, if you're curious. had to change a lot to be able to use left hand only


[1/19/2026 8:16 AM] rud87
thank you for trying to help but I wiped the installation and downloads for good

just got to lvl 30 on 0.5.8.0 and see that there's a 0.5.8.2 out already. should i start over?


[1/19/2026 8:36 AM] killthemind
Anyone else's BodySlide's changing mid-game for no reason? Clothing seems to work well (brand new character) but after a while sliders just break and poof


[1/19/2026 8:38 AM] killthemind
~~It seems to happen on equipping any Eyeglasses/accessories~~


[1/19/2026 8:42 AM] killthemind
Nvm eyeglasses doesn't do it, I can't nail down what causes it


[1/19/2026 8:54 AM] killthemind
It seems like a lot of meshes are off


[1/19/2026 9:03 AM] kazifca
Q and E are left unused as it’s expected you’ll probably want to lean, uneducated shooter in MO2. 
Or you can use them for whatever you want


[1/19/2026 9:10 AM] killthemind
How do you set them to lean?


[1/19/2026 9:12 AM] kazifca
Turn on the mod in MO2, make sure you read notes, then go into MCM and set the hotkeys


[1/19/2026 9:14 AM] killthemind
Sounds good. How can I get meshes to work consistently with clothing? It seems like there's some clash where some are right, some aren't, then out of nowhere they're not and default to some other preset


[1/19/2026 9:15 AM] killthemind
Do I need to start a new character after attempting to fix in bodyslide?


[1/19/2026 9:17 AM] kazifca
You may have to open up bodyslide


[1/19/2026 9:20 AM] killthemind
I already did, batch applied a normal preset- but it doesn't seem to be carrying into the game


[1/19/2026 9:21 AM] naggoob
thanks for the help n info guys


[1/19/2026 9:21 AM] kazifca
Hm


[1/19/2026 9:22 AM] kazifca
In support, create a post and post some reference images


[1/19/2026 9:22 AM] kazifca
Will make mine & Eizers life easier if it becomes a returning issue


[1/19/2026 9:27 AM] zaja0479
Holster your gun for some reason the animation doesnt want to play out if youre holding anything


[1/19/2026 9:30 AM] streikeizer
Q and E are for uneducated shooter an optional mod


[1/19/2026 9:52 AM] naggoob
aah, okey


[1/19/2026 9:57 AM] daninjah
i just noticed it, disabled in the modlist, huh. is it any good? do you use leaning a lot? wonder i there are issues with collisions and stuff, like if you get shot in the legs while leaning out


[1/19/2026 9:58 AM] kazifca
Theres collison issues in vault 111 lol


[1/19/2026 9:58 AM] daninjah
explains the note in MO2 😄


[1/19/2026 9:59 AM] kazifca
Leaning is really useful once you actually start using it


[1/19/2026 9:59 AM] kazifca
If you already use a ton of cover and approach things sneaky, it's just another tool to make that go smoother against more enemies


[1/19/2026 10:00 AM] daninjah
well i get headshotted quite a lot so that will definitely help


[1/19/2026 10:02 AM] kazifca
I added it in my third playthrough I think, still was getting used to it but it definitely helps in the subways, tight spaces, bouncing between cover obviously, it's applicable, fallout just has us trained not to lean


[1/19/2026 10:05 AM] daninjah
i just started on 0.5.8.0 and blown away by how good Anomaly is, played 3 days non-stop lol. time for a restart i guess, with leaning and without ancient tunnels. maybe the melee is viable now!


[1/19/2026 10:05 AM] kazifca
Naw


[1/19/2026 10:05 AM] kazifca
guns will still do ya dirty


[1/19/2026 10:06 AM] kazifca
Hard to justify using a wrench when everyone is shooting at you with guns from 30ft away


[1/19/2026 10:06 AM] kazifca
or be, incredibly sneaky


[1/19/2026 10:06 AM] daninjah
impossible early game

The new vegas method exists, not everyones fav but can be done with enough heart


[1/19/2026 10:07 AM] daninjah
does every helmet needs to be legendary marked as "MAIM: helmet"? might explain why i get 360-noscoped by pipegun raiders in army helmets


[1/19/2026 10:08 AM] kazifca
No, it's kinda hard to explain but maim changes how damage calculations are done


[1/19/2026 10:08 AM] kazifca
So, in mcm look for maim, and look for headshots


[1/19/2026 10:08 AM] kazifca
I know what the stats are


[1/19/2026 10:09 AM] kazifca
so I also know you get shot in the head a lot, or are incredibly unlucky lmao


[1/19/2026 10:09 AM] daninjah
yeah, 60% probability of dying a death on headshot IIRC

I'm trying to dig into it and I can't figure it out


[1/19/2026 10:25 AM] kazifca
I've heard about this before in one of the more general modding discords, online it's saying along the lines of
'Clothes have individual presets for their bodies, so if you're naked body & clothed body are different you'll have to rebuild outfits for the preset'


[1/19/2026 10:27 AM] kazifca
you've already been in bodyslide so, I'm sure you've tried that, I'm not super familiar with the program, but if you can find a way to slap it into a plugin you can then, go into xEdit and find what's been touching ya stuff if it's not the rebuilt outfits alone


[1/19/2026 10:27 AM] killthemind
How do I do that? And shouldn't a mass-batch from bodyslide work?


[1/19/2026 10:28 AM] kazifca
I don't think I can send links yet, dm me cause I can't send you the link


[1/19/2026 11:24 AM] darklary
Hey everyone get excited I have a new problem I can't solve.


[1/19/2026 11:25 AM] darklary
So, before I begin. I have no status effects at all. None. Full health. Full limb condition. However, my screen goes blurry like my head is crippled every 20 seconds or so. No idea how to get this to stop.


[1/19/2026 11:26 AM] geckornjoe.
my install from wabbajack never added any files with the exception of the mods, any ideas?


[1/19/2026 11:28 AM] darklary
I don't understand exactly what you're asking.


[1/19/2026 11:30 AM] geckornjoe.
when i download the pack from wabbajack into a dedicated folder, it creates a downloads folder and places the mods inside which makes sense, but inside the fallout anomaly folder there are no files such as mod organizer 2


[1/19/2026 11:31 AM] geckornjoe.
nor are they in the folder that i downloaded wabbajack into


[1/19/2026 11:32 AM] geckornjoe.
im trying a new install now but am unsure what the problem could be


[1/19/2026 11:34 AM] darklary
so it only downloaded the files? Didn't install them?


[1/19/2026 11:35 AM] geckornjoe.
yeah it seems like it


[1/19/2026 11:36 AM] geckornjoe.
im scanning the log viewer to see if it downloaded the other files to an odd directory


[1/19/2026 11:36 AM] darklary
did it mention if it maybe didn't manage to download all the files correctly?


[1/19/2026 11:37 AM] darklary
I had an issue on the previous version where the ENB wasn't downloading correctly, and that was stopping the entire process.


[1/19/2026 11:37 AM] geckornjoe.
yeah there were a couple that i had to get from nexus


[1/19/2026 11:38 AM] darklary
you manually put them into the downloads folder?


[1/19/2026 11:38 AM] darklary
just, as is after the download?


[1/19/2026 11:41 AM] geckornjoe.
yeah i didnt unpack them at all


[1/19/2026 11:43 AM] darklary
so you put the ones it couldn't get into downloads, didn't upnack them, and then restarted wabajack and told it to download the mods again? Still didn't work?


[1/19/2026 11:46 AM] geckornjoe.
yeah


[1/19/2026 11:46 AM] geckornjoe.
fresh install just finished


[1/19/2026 11:47 AM] geckornjoe.
and this time the list of mods thsat i need to manually put in is like an additional 22 mods and that a main menu loop file is missing


[1/19/2026 11:47 AM] geckornjoe.
fresh install of FO4?


[1/19/2026 11:48 AM] darklary
did you launch fallout 4 after installing it before downloading the modpack?


[1/19/2026 11:48 AM] geckornjoe.
yeah


[1/19/2026 11:52 AM] darklary
Well, if fallout is missing files first I'd reccomend verifying on steam.


[1/19/2026 11:53 AM] darklary
If THAT doesn't work, then perhaps a clean install.


[1/19/2026 11:53 AM] geckornjoe.
ok thats what im trying rn


[1/19/2026 12:06 PM] geckornjoe.
the only thing i cant do in the process is add an virus protection exception


[1/19/2026 12:07 PM] geckornjoe.
this is a new computer with win11 on it and all reasearched solutions are inconclusive could that be preventing the file installs


[1/19/2026 12:10 PM] darklary
I'm not familiar with 11 myself.


[1/19/2026 12:11 PM] darklary
Wait, do you have the required dlcs?


[1/19/2026 12:11 PM] geckornjoe.
yeah


[1/19/2026 12:12 PM] geckornjoe.
and the hdr pack isnt even downloaded

[1/19/2026 12:44 PM] hasjcira
Hi everyone, I'm installing the mods from the modpack and I wanted to know if it's possible to install them without necessarily having downloaded all the mods from wabbajack.


[1/19/2026 12:45 PM] hasjcira
Because I'm installing it manually : P

[1/19/2026 12:48 PM] geckornjoe.
it seems like only the mods are are being installed and none of the other files like MO2


[1/19/2026 12:48 PM] kazifca
It's installing?


[1/19/2026 12:48 PM] kazifca
like in the process, and you can't find MO2


[1/19/2026 12:48 PM] kazifca
or it installed with no MO2


[1/19/2026 12:49 PM] geckornjoe.
it installed without it


[1/19/2026 12:49 PM] kazifca
Go onto wabbajack if you haven't already


[1/19/2026 12:49 PM] kazifca
go back into anomaly


[1/19/2026 12:49 PM] kazifca
click install, make sure you select the right downloads folder, so you don't redownload all your mods

You have a profile with no MO2?

[1/19/2026 12:53 PM] hasjcira
Wow, I hope he didn't go to heaven, but this used to happen when I played vanilla and I'd reload a save.


[1/19/2026 12:54 PM] hasjcira
Try going to his place of origin, he might be there.


[1/19/2026 12:54 PM] nimshi89
I did do that still gone, gone for good...I knew that dog wasnt loyal


[1/19/2026 12:54 PM] nimshi89
oh okay yeah I'll try that


[1/19/2026 12:55 PM] hasjcira
I'm slightly anxious to get to that part.


[1/19/2026 12:58 PM] kazifca
He installed in his root directory


[1/19/2026 12:59 PM] kazifca
That's why he's having troubles, as long as you don't do that you'll be okay


[1/19/2026 1:00 PM] hasjcira
You mean, he installed it on "C (windows)" and the game is on "D"?


[1/19/2026 1:00 PM] kazifca
No, the same location his game is, he choose to install the modpack


[1/19/2026 1:01 PM] hasjcira
in the game folder?


[1/19/2026 1:02 PM] kazifca
In program files, yes

Cool, after I install it, do I just open the MO2 installed by Anomaly and play it?


[1/19/2026 1:04 PM] kazifca
Basically, it's made to be very streamlined


[1/19/2026 1:05 PM] kazifca
look through optionals


[1/19/2026 1:05 PM] kazifca
Check the read me to make sure you didn't miss anything, read notes


[1/19/2026 1:05 PM] kazifca

[1/19/2026 1:28 PM] darklary
To make sure I'm doing this correctly, you want me to look in MO2 itself for an overwrites category?

yea


[1/19/2026 1:30 PM] kazifca

I think it might be related to the "on shock" status effect from MAIM.


[1/19/2026 1:32 PM] darklary
However, after taking medex to treat the shock, the effect remains forever.


[1/19/2026 1:32 PM] darklary
Seems to happen when I take large amounts of damage suddenly.


[1/19/2026 1:32 PM] kazifca
Could it happen to be an interaction between AP and perception?


[1/19/2026 1:32 PM] darklary
Meaning?


[1/19/2026 1:33 PM] kazifca
I find if my AP is low my vision goes blurry sometimes


[1/19/2026 1:33 PM] darklary
Nah, full AP


[1/19/2026 1:33 PM] darklary
my perception is a 3, in case that's helpful info.


[1/19/2026 1:33 PM] kazifca
Hm, and reloading obvi hasn't fixed the issue


[1/19/2026 1:33 PM] kazifca
I think you might be right on the MAIM effect


[1/19/2026 1:33 PM] darklary
it does, if I go back 2 days to the last time I went to far harbor lol.


[1/19/2026 1:34 PM] darklary
regretably, the saves system has only left me with 3 autosaves that all have the effect happening.


[1/19/2026 1:34 PM] kazifca
I wonder if it's accidentally firing, or if there's a medicine you need to take


[1/19/2026 1:34 PM] darklary
I can run some tests with the far harbor save. See what I discover.


[1/19/2026 1:35 PM] darklary
is this perhaps a known issue with uneducated shooter?


[1/19/2026 1:35 PM] darklary
That's the only optional mod I have turned on.


[1/19/2026 1:35 PM] kazifca
I wouldn't think so, I don't think uneducated shooter would touch any settings that do that specific kind of effect


[1/19/2026 1:36 PM] kazifca
Maybe pop xedit open and take a look rq


[1/19/2026 1:36 PM] darklary
I didn't think so either. But this started yesterday, which is when i turned that on.


[1/19/2026 1:37 PM] darklary
Where would that be located?


[1/19/2026 1:37 PM] kazifca
the drop down by run


[1/19/2026 1:37 PM] kazifca
Look for FO4edit


[1/19/2026 1:37 PM] darklary
ah gotcha


[1/19/2026 1:38 PM] darklary
And I'd be wanting to look at MAIM, I'm guessing. Since that's the suspected mod


[1/19/2026 1:38 PM] kazifca
well

if it started with uneducated shooter


[1/19/2026 1:38 PM] jackson21a
Heya sorry for the dumb question but it’s been awhile sense I’ve last played and I was curious. How do I craft ammo? I chose a background that had fusion cells unlocked from the get go. And I wanted to see what it took to make a few


[1/19/2026 1:38 PM] kazifca
start there


[1/19/2026 1:38 PM] kazifca
Ammo workbench


[1/19/2026 1:39 PM] simmic1945
Where can i get more items to save? for the life of me cant find any and traders dont seem to offer it


[1/19/2026 1:39 PM] kazifca
if it's empty you need schematics


[1/19/2026 1:39 PM] darklary
Oddly enough, US isn't here.


[1/19/2026 1:40 PM] kazifca
Ok that means the plugin is named something other than the file


[1/19/2026 1:40 PM] kazifca
you can unlock MO2 with xedit open


[1/19/2026 1:40 PM] darklary
I've for the sake of testing, disabled the mod in MO2


[1/19/2026 1:40 PM] kazifca
look for uneducated shooter, click it, look at the plugin pane, find the name, plug that into xedit


[1/19/2026 1:40 PM] jackson21a
Thank you and what’s a good way to get military cartridges?


[1/19/2026 1:41 PM] kazifca
How early are you into the game


[1/19/2026 1:41 PM] simmic1945
About 2 hours in


[1/19/2026 1:41 PM] kazifca
Don't buy shi, don't get sick, and don't waste ammo, also scrounger


[1/19/2026 1:42 PM] darklary
Also, keep your eyes open for stashes. 🙂


[1/19/2026 1:42 PM] kazifca
Literally, just explore the POIs, there's cigarettes in sanctuary, the vault 111 management facility, ranger cabin I think, USAF


[1/19/2026 1:43 PM] darklary
if you live long enough to start "calling all patriots" you can make some SERIOUS money from that.


[1/19/2026 1:43 PM] darklary
also, all the cigs you'll ever need.


[1/19/2026 1:54 PM] caughtmedead
I think I figured it out. If you want the cigarette animation to play each time, put your weapon away, and use the cigarette from the radial menu H


[1/19/2026 1:58 PM] caughtmedead
Hey man thanks for taking the time to reply. The mod pack is fkin awesome, I see you get your balls busted a lot cuz it’s a hard modpack. These people have probably never played stalker let alone anomaly mod lol. Just felt like I had to say that 😂 and is the robco patch a holotape or an mcm mod? Sorry i just usually don’t mod fallout 🙏


[1/19/2026 2:03 PM] darklary
Think I found my solution!


[1/19/2026 2:03 PM] darklary
I turned off ALL the visual effects for mild/severe pain and limb crippling. Then, clicked reinstall in the MCM for MAIM


[1/19/2026 2:03 PM] darklary
that seems to have cleared the blurriness.


[1/19/2026 2:04 PM] darklary
also, keep in mind that I'm on the previous version from before this recent update went out. Also, the solution was in the bugs section on the nexus for the old, depreciated version of MAIM.


[1/19/2026 2:12 PM] dallas9911
Raiders are either naked or wearing a gas mask but they have everything in there inventory


[1/19/2026 2:13 PM] darklary
Ah, is the armor in their inventory like, full body? Or might block a gasmask?


[1/19/2026 2:13 PM] dallas9911
My guess is the gas masks are blocking the armor


[1/19/2026 2:13 PM] kazifca
Theres a fix for this somewhere online I'm ngl


[1/19/2026 2:13 PM] kazifca
I'm pretty sure it's a gas masks of the wasteland issue


[1/19/2026 2:14 PM] kazifca
specifically the plugin that hits npcs


[1/19/2026 2:14 PM] kazifca
Gasmask_NPC or sumn like that idk


[1/19/2026 2:15 PM] dallas9911
think i found it


[1/19/2026 2:15 PM] kazifca
It's an npc plugin


[1/19/2026 2:15 PM] darklary
Also, Kaz, I think MAIM might just start to have issues after enough game time maybe. Doing the reinstall seems to have fixed the issue. Can't even get the blur to come back with all the effects turned on.


[1/19/2026 2:15 PM] kazifca
do not disable it an load a save


[1/19/2026 2:16 PM] kazifca
I think this is the goal of MAIM 3 tbf


[1/19/2026 2:16 PM] kazifca
Which is still in beta of course


[1/19/2026 2:16 PM] darklary
Ah, gotcha gotcha.


[1/19/2026 2:17 PM] darklary
Well, for the MOST PART, no complaints.


[1/19/2026 2:18 PM] kazifca
Ay, thats all you can ask for from modded BGS games


[1/19/2026 2:21 PM] darklary
For sure


[1/19/2026 2:21 PM] darklary
I'm just glad my level 60 character isn't broken beyond repair.


[1/19/2026 2:24 PM] kazifca
To be fair, they did a pretty good job at creating the conditions that requires you make a character applicable to the situation


[1/19/2026 2:25 PM] darklary
Indeed. And, the solution was literally hitting one button


[1/19/2026 2:25 PM] kazifca
Sneak?


[1/19/2026 2:25 PM] kazifca
lmao


[1/19/2026 2:34 PM] .robo_
can you find cleansing tonic in the world? I'm having a really hard time enjoying the rad system, seems super tedious and the gas masks are inconsistently effective. the starter gas mask has 700+ more rad protection than anything else I've found 25 hours in


[1/19/2026 2:36 PM] caughtmedead
Just looking through right now, Do I have to right-click re-install the RobCo Patcher mod in the mod manager?


[1/19/2026 2:40 PM] kazifca
RAD dr is important to worldspace hazards and spells, not the gas masks of the wasteland mechanic


[1/19/2026 2:40 PM] kazifca
That's it's own script entirely


[1/19/2026 2:40 PM] bellusci
Goood day guys, anyone knows how to remove the annoying depth oof field effect? cant find it anywhere


[1/19/2026 2:41 PM] kazifca

mo2


[1/19/2026 2:41 PM] gachaaddicted
So I want to try out this modpack, is there a version of fallout 4 I need to buy first? Would it be GOTY or Anniversary edition? 

And do I just install it on wabbajack and play or do I have to do some steps before downloading through wabbajack?


[1/19/2026 2:41 PM] bellusci
Not the scope, just regular


[1/19/2026 2:43 PM] kazifca
I know, but if it's not in ini's or the MCM, then you gotta start trying stuff that gives a DOF effect to find your solution, I highly doubt its the scopes lmao, but you're gonna have to troubleshoot a lil


[1/19/2026 2:43 PM] .robo_
why do I accumulate rads when wearing a 100% condition 50 rad protection gas mask?


[1/19/2026 2:44 PM] kazifca
probably a worldspace hazard, if it's not the gmotw script nuking you


[1/19/2026 2:44 PM] .robo_
just walking through fog unfortunately :blobSad:


[1/19/2026 2:45 PM] kazifca
yep


[1/19/2026 2:45 PM] kazifca
rad DR will help a little with that


[1/19/2026 2:45 PM] kazifca
but if it's that blurry vision 80+ rads a second shi


[1/19/2026 2:45 PM] kazifca
thats gmotw


[1/19/2026 2:46 PM] .robo_
death by "in my restless dreams I see that town" fog 😡


[1/19/2026 2:46 PM] kazifca
Whats the rads per sec


[1/19/2026 2:48 PM] streikeizer
One of the files under the Level lists folder.


[1/19/2026 2:50 PM] .robo_
it wasn't anything crazy. it usually builds up over like <1 rads. and then no matter how many of those yellow stims I spam it doesn't ever go away. Very minor interactions with rads results in a permanent irradiated status that force me to go to a doctor


[1/19/2026 2:50 PM] streikeizer
This solved the issue for me

[1/19/2026 2:53 PM] dallas9911
read the read me


[1/19/2026 2:54 PM] kazifca
I think it's outdated atm


[1/19/2026 2:54 PM] kazifca
opening wabba


[1/19/2026 2:54 PM] dallas9911
I was pretty certin it said the most uptodate version


[1/19/2026 2:54 PM] streikeizer
I might have forgot to change the version number on wabbajack gallery


[1/19/2026 2:54 PM] streikeizer
Now that I look myself


[1/19/2026 2:55 PM] streikeizer
:PepeCRY:


[1/19/2026 2:55 PM] streikeizer
Once you download it. It should show the correct version number


[1/19/2026 2:55 PM] gachaaddicted
I'm just not sure if I should buy the GOTY or Anniversary Edition. 

I see it on the wabbajack, I just know I need to own the game first before installing it right? I'm new to this whole modding scene.


[1/19/2026 2:56 PM] streikeizer
I have goty


[1/19/2026 2:56 PM] streikeizer
I think


[1/19/2026 2:56 PM] streikeizer
Tbh I have no clue


[1/19/2026 2:56 PM] kazifca
GOTY is just no CC content bundle at this point I'm pre sure


[1/19/2026 2:56 PM] dallas9911
Ive got GOTY


[1/19/2026 2:56 PM] kazifca
But GOTY


[1/19/2026 2:57 PM] kazifca
Always safer


[1/19/2026 2:57 PM] gachaaddicted
I'll go with that one then.


[1/19/2026 2:57 PM] kazifca

[1/19/2026 2:58 PM] streikeizer
why is radx not working


[1/19/2026 2:59 PM] dallas9911
I would use the yellow stim and the rads wouldnt clear , I know they the stim doesnt clear the other effects but the actual rad wasnt clearing


[1/19/2026 2:59 PM] kazifca

So I got fallout 4 and tried to install the modpack but it says it can't find the game. 

I even tried opening Fallout 4 through steam and closing it but it's still giving the same result.


[1/19/2026 3:42 PM] kazifca
Yeah so thats on your installs end


[1/19/2026 3:42 PM] kazifca
verify game files


[1/19/2026 3:42 PM] kazifca
you'll wanna run vanilla once before installing


[1/19/2026 3:42 PM] kazifca
Wait


[1/19/2026 3:42 PM] dallas9911
Depends on how you feel about the enclave


[1/19/2026 3:42 PM] kazifca
sorry


[1/19/2026 3:42 PM] kazifca
that was mega retardo of me


[1/19/2026 3:42 PM] gachaaddicted
How do I verify the game files? By opening the game and starting a playthrough fully?


[1/19/2026 3:42 PM] kazifca
That was my tism going full bore


[1/19/2026 3:43 PM] kazifca
In steam, right click the fallout 4 icon, menu option, whatever it is for you


[1/19/2026 3:43 PM] kazifca

[1/19/2026 3:44 PM] kazifca

Oooh what I know is that they kinda view everyone else as savages.


[1/19/2026 3:44 PM] gachaaddicted
Verifying right now. I'll boot up the game after and see what happens when installing the modpack


[1/19/2026 3:46 PM] gachaaddicted
Another quick question. I see there's a section here for controller support. Is that already part of the modpack or something I gotta do myself?


[1/19/2026 3:46 PM] dallas9911
but it is a mod that adds more content


[1/19/2026 3:46 PM] kazifca
I cannot answer that, I haven't touched a controller in years but if Eizer is prowling he might have more insight


[1/19/2026 3:47 PM] gachaaddicted
Gotcha. 
Still says it can't find the game. I verified the files and closed it. 

Opened the game up and closed that. Still can't find the game. I went back to properties and it's giving me the option to verify the files again. Did it not go through?


[1/19/2026 3:48 PM] dallas9911
where is wabbajck installed


[1/19/2026 3:48 PM] dallas9911

[1/19/2026 3:48 PM] gachaaddicted
It's installed in my C drive!


[1/19/2026 3:49 PM] jackson21a
So I’m getting some rad ticks despite having a gas mask with 90 percent on the filter? Any ideas


[1/19/2026 3:49 PM] dallas9911
and fallout 4 as well the C drive?


[1/19/2026 3:49 PM] gachaaddicted
Uhhhh


[1/19/2026 3:49 PM] gachaaddicted
Lemme see.


[1/19/2026 3:51 PM] gachaaddicted
Yes, I see it in my users appdata folder under the C Drive.


[1/19/2026 3:53 PM] dallas9911
C:\WabbaJack- folder
C:\steam\steamapps\common/fallout 4


[1/19/2026 3:54 PM] dallas9911
trying moving your steam outside off appdata as well as outside of program files or x 86


[1/19/2026 4:00 PM] gachaaddicted
Are those two c drive comments what I put for the install/download location?


[1/19/2026 4:01 PM] gachaaddicted
I can't seem to find my steam files at the moment.


[1/19/2026 4:01 PM] dallas9911
find out where your steam is and make sure its not in program files or X86 program files


[1/19/2026 4:04 PM] gachaaddicted
Ahh I see.


[1/19/2026 4:04 PM] gachaaddicted
Yea it's in the X86


[1/19/2026 4:04 PM] gachaaddicted
What do I move steam to then?


[1/19/2026 4:05 PM] dallas9911
yes IMO uninstall it and reinstall it to just the c drive


[1/19/2026 4:06 PM] gachaaddicted
Uninstall fallout you mean or the steam file as a whole?


[1/19/2026 4:06 PM] gachaaddicted
Like copy and paste into the c drive on its own.


[1/19/2026 4:07 PM] dallas9911
everything need to be in c drive depending on you drives write speed it might be faster to uninstall eveything


[1/19/2026 4:08 PM] gachaaddicted
So you mean to uninstall through steam and try to install it and change its place into the C drive?


[1/19/2026 4:08 PM] dallas9911
yes


[1/19/2026 4:08 PM] gachaaddicted
I'm just gonna try and copy the steam folder and move it into the C drive. See if that does anything.

if the Dr bugs out and wont clear your rads or he does the animation and doesn't remove the debuffs you need to tonic

It should take a second then launch your game

Hello, Im new to Anomaly, and wondering what is the best way to play the list. Is it more just explore and survive vs doing quest? Also it seems like I'm constantly fighting injury, sickness, etc. How does  deal with this. Any tips are greatly appreciated. Thanks


[1/19/2026 6:49 PM] hue3147
first playthrough... just made it out the vault.... seems like when i wear the radiation mask it makes the game darker then when i dont have it on? is this normal or someway to tweak this?

open you pip boy go to misc and find settings, gas mask holotape

@hue INV to misc to gas mask holo then I believe screen effects  is where it is

So far, during character creator I can't use the controller. I'll try and look through the mods for that after. 

Another issue I have is I'm trying to add facial hair. Screen shows I need to press T for it but nothing comes up.

Look in the steam controller inputs channel

With sleeping, cigarettes, or survival packs


[1/19/2026 7:19 PM] gachaaddicted
Okay so I managed to enable controller on the settings and it kinda worked. 

I can use a controller button on the "press any button" screen but after that nothing works.


[1/19/2026 7:19 PM] jackson21a
Hey I made an ammunition work bench but I can see all the ammo recipes and I thought you needed the military thing to make the ammo bench?


[1/19/2026 7:19 PM] kazifca
You don’t have immersion crafting on


[1/19/2026 7:20 PM] kazifca
So don’t worry about schematics


[1/19/2026 7:20 PM] gachaaddicted
Where's this link in the controller support mod I'm seeing to put an input in?


[1/19/2026 7:20 PM] jackson21a
Is there a way to turn it on? It almost feels too easy.


[1/19/2026 7:21 PM] kazifca
Look for crafting mastery 2


[1/19/2026 7:21 PM] jackson21a
Thx


[1/19/2026 7:22 PM] jackson21a
And while your here is their anyway to bring an apc to an owned settlement?


[1/19/2026 7:22 PM] kazifca
There’s some way to do it, I’ve never done it before


[1/19/2026 7:22 PM] kazifca
The mod page itself mentions it on there I think


[1/19/2026 7:24 PM] jackson21a
Darn That be usful if I wandered off. Do you think it be op if I could do that? Because I feel like as long as you own the settlement it’d be fair


[1/19/2026 7:25 PM] kazifca
Naw that typa stuff doesn’t make the game too easy for me


[1/19/2026 7:25 PM] kazifca
There’s a couple things, a lot of it is just how vanilla AI handles combat


[1/19/2026 7:29 PM] jackson21a
It’s says it’s a holotape? Any idea on how to spawn a holotoape?


[1/19/2026 7:29 PM] kazifca
Well find the ID


[1/19/2026 7:30 PM] kazifca
So help “item name” 4


[1/19/2026 7:30 PM] kazifca
Look around the APC page


[1/19/2026 7:30 PM] kazifca
It might have a keyword for that command somewhere


[1/19/2026 8:02 PM] jackson21a
I finally found it. Honestly this feature should be tied into a new craft able. I mean its lore friendly makes sense and isnt too op

[1/19/2026 8:56 PM] dallas9911
anyone thought of how this would play with frost?


[1/19/2026 8:57 PM] kazifca
probably not well


[1/19/2026 8:57 PM] kazifca
though thats something I'd like to resolve in the future (if humanly possible)


[1/19/2026 8:59 PM] dallas9911
would have to be a new list based around frost then made to be more like anomaly


[1/19/2026 9:00 PM] kazifca
essentially, that's something I'm gonna work on if I can though, thats a modular concept thing I wanna try getting active


[1/19/2026 9:01 PM] dallas9911
That would be sick, One of the NV lists had a dust preset


[1/19/2026 9:02 PM] kazifca
Well, for frost to work you'd have to boil anomaly's core mechanics into frost applicable mods


[1/19/2026 9:03 PM] kazifca
Which could def work, just would also mean all the excess in the pack may have to go for frost to play nice


[1/19/2026 9:04 PM] dallas9911
for sure there are too many armors in each factions table Rn found gunners with 4 armor sets each


[1/19/2026 9:07 PM] kazifca
Suprisingly, that's probably the easy part, frost is also a gameplay overhaul


[1/19/2026 9:07 PM] kazifca
A huge one at that


[1/19/2026 9:43 PM] nomad5157

I'll check out the new server soon definitely wanna check out what you're cooking, my buddies just mentioned that game to me


[1/19/2026 9:48 PM] nomad5157
Sounds good 😄 It's a fun game to chill on


[1/19/2026 9:48 PM] kazifca
Also gonna have to ask you what you did to grenades, so I can also do it, later though :FancyPepe:


[1/19/2026 10:06 PM] naggoob
I tried out the lean mod, just to see what it was like but I can't say it did much for me so I disabled it again. But now I know


[1/19/2026 10:32 PM] nomad5157

anyone have a good 21:9 compatibility fix for the glass vignette on gas masks of the wasteland?

[1/19/2026 10:57 PM] gachaaddicted
So the gas mask icon in the top left corner is flashing red. 

I've replaced the filter, tried to clean it. What does it mean?


[1/19/2026 10:57 PM] kazifca
It means your filter is in use


[1/19/2026 10:57 PM] kazifca
change it at 5% if you can


[1/19/2026 10:59 PM] gachaaddicted
Any idea how I can check that?

Also my character seems dizzy and I'm not sure why. I.. the vault opening was not a great start for me (most stuff just wasn't there) so I got a damaged limb. Bleeding and the stimpaks helped some but the wound is still there. 

This is harder than I thought.


[1/19/2026 10:59 PM] kazifca
Do you not have the hudwidget?


[1/19/2026 11:00 PM] kazifca
and also man, don't be afraid to restart, it took me a few tries


[1/19/2026 11:00 PM] caughtmedead
Try pressing F2 a couple times if the HUD starts bugged


[1/19/2026 11:00 PM] caughtmedead
Also, yeah, treat sanctuary hills like rookie village, and expect to be there a lot xD


[1/19/2026 11:03 PM] gachaaddicted
I believe I have the hudgewidget.

But yea I might have to start a new game. Didn't have a baton, wrench, the medical supplies weren't there and not even a gun.


[1/19/2026 11:03 PM] kazifca
🤨


[1/19/2026 11:03 PM] kazifca
Now that one is odd


[1/19/2026 11:04 PM] gachaaddicted
It was my third retry for the vault and yea. First two times was no issue but this time it was. 

Not even that zombie thing was there when I opened the door.


[1/19/2026 11:05 PM] kazifca
Odd, yeah I'd probably take that as a message that sumn was up and reload


[1/19/2026 11:05 PM] kazifca
thats not normal


[1/19/2026 11:07 PM] gachaaddicted
Just Incase I went ahead and deleted all the prior starts I had. It's possible that had a part in it.


[1/19/2026 11:07 PM] kazifca

[1/19/2026 11:30 PM] .robo_
for fomod, the settings are "true storms compatibility" only -> then gas mask npc, gas mask climate -> and then all the aspect ratio & fov stuff, yeah?


[1/19/2026 11:31 PM] kazifca
you may wanna note what those are for options, cancel the reinstall, check the list and then go back and hit reinstall


[1/19/2026 11:32 PM] .robo_
I'm unsure because for some of these it doesn't say


[1/19/2026 11:32 PM] kazifca
Eizer is the current man who runs the show, you'll wanna look through modules not plugins


[1/19/2026 11:34 PM] kazifca
TS is in there, so def include that


[1/19/2026 11:34 PM] kazifca
you can honestly include all of them and if you're missing a master de-select the plugin in the right window of MO2


[1/19/2026 11:34 PM] kazifca
That's usually what I do, trying to find an alternative to GMoTW tho


[1/19/2026 11:35 PM] .robo_
I'm hesitant to mess with it tooooo much bc I'm in a really long playthrough and it's not a huge deal


[1/19/2026 11:35 PM] kazifca
I mean, backup your save before touching your LO if you care about your save


[1/19/2026 11:36 PM] kazifca
thats just good practice in general


[1/19/2026 11:52 PM] kazifca
if you're missing the masters, it'll tell you in MO2

[1/19/2026 11:52 PM] kazifca
by the heart at the top right corner


[1/19/2026 11:52 PM] kazifca
right beside it


[1/19/2026 11:52 PM] kazifca
you can click that to check for missing masters


[1/19/2026 11:52 PM] kazifca
ignore the overwrite directory


[1/19/2026 11:55 PM] .robo_
in case anyone searches this chat function, reinstalled Gas Masks of the Wasteland (GMOTW) for 21:9 by hitting reinstall, enabling ONLY True storms -> (next) check everything except "climate" -> 21:9 -> (default is 90 fov)


[1/19/2026 11:56 PM] bootineye
Been wondering, I remember at some point seeing one of the ARs with a grenade launcher for the underbarrel attachment. Does the GL actually work or is it just for visuals


[1/19/2026 11:56 PM] kazifca
it should have a mechanic that makes it work


[1/20/2026 12:13 AM] gachaaddicted
I'm trying to build a bed for the settlement so I can sleep in it but it's not giving me the option to. I have the materials for it!


[1/20/2026 12:13 AM] gachaaddicted
Is it because the settlement isn't counting for myself?


[1/20/2026 12:16 AM] kazifca
That's odd, like it just, refuses to place it?


[1/20/2026 12:17 AM] gachaaddicted
Ah wait


[1/20/2026 12:17 AM] gachaaddicted
No I figured it out.


[1/20/2026 12:18 AM] gachaaddicted
I had the materials but it wasn't disassembled or something.


[1/20/2026 12:18 AM] gachaaddicted
That or there wasn't any room. I got a bed set up :8276_Cool_Finger_Guns:


[1/20/2026 1:01 AM] meatshower
Nothing that indicates an injury. Same in active effects.


[1/20/2026 1:19 AM] darklary
In the MCM go to combat>MAIM>pain and turn off mild and major pain cause blur, same for crippled limbs. Save then reload. If that doesn't work, go back into the MCM, confirm the settings saved, and then in it's main screen, click reinstall and exit the menu. Let it do it's thing, drop a save, reload.

[1/20/2026 4:48 AM] nimshi89
okay is there a console command to make a quest that bugged be finished?


[1/20/2026 4:54 AM] streikeizer
Yeah but its kinda annoying. you gotta pop in the console "sqs" Then find the correct quest ID then use "GetStage <QuestID>" And then Find a the correct stage to finsh the quest in there.

[1/20/2026 5:12 AM] streikeizer
should open the console if you press `. you should be able to type stuff


[1/20/2026 5:12 AM] streikeizer
its not blocked


[1/20/2026 5:14 AM] streikeizer
Also quick note about the cleansing tonic. It only spawns on Doctors aswell. Should be a 50% chance to find one on them. I also added 1 in the vault 111 chest.


[1/20/2026 5:15 AM] streikeizer
Removed the M2 and some Leftover esps aswell.


[1/20/2026 5:21 AM] caughtmedead

clean bed?


[1/20/2026 10:35 AM] simmic1945
crafted one in a settlement


[1/20/2026 10:37 AM] darklary
it's not telling you anything like: "Can't sleep more than 5 hours on a dirty matress" For some reason?

nope. able to sleep for full 24 hours if i like

Hey i can't boiled water ? apparently i need lead belly 2, do i miss something? invest two level seems a bit expensive


[1/20/2026 10:45 AM] darklary
No, you didn't miss anything. You need lead belly 2 to boil water. Thankfully boiled/purified water are just 2 of many ways to recover thirst. Also, there's a spot in concord that lets you make infinite purified water for nearly free. No perks needed.


[1/20/2026 10:47 AM] jeandenaoded
oh ok thanks


[1/20/2026 10:49 AM] simmic1945
tried restarting, yea nothing gets rid of this sleep debuff

That's an odd one then. I'm looking online for solutions.


[1/20/2026 11:01 AM] kazifca
what is the debuff called


[1/20/2026 11:01 AM] kazifca
there should be an effect tab or sumn like that in your pipboy


[1/20/2026 11:01 AM] kazifca
or press q when looking at the menu that lets you hotkey stimpacks and radaway


[1/20/2026 11:04 AM] naggoob
So I don't know if this is a known issue or a me issue but when I went down into the Concord sewers there was what seemed like three objects that were faulty. I can post a picture of how it looks if you'd like.


[1/20/2026 11:10 AM] nimshi89
The one where I have to go kill a raider and save 3 caravan memebers who are locked in cells. one of them after I open the cage goes but the other two just stays and I cant progress with the quest.


[1/20/2026 11:11 AM] kazifca
Yeah

[1/20/2026 11:11 AM] kazifca

I can't help you get an ID based on that lol


[1/20/2026 11:12 AM] kazifca
Quest ID's (vanilla atleast), shouldn't be changed, as I had to cheat my way through the oswald quest in nukaworld because I did the thing in the 'WroNG OrdER'

there any info on YAE and ECO compatibility? are weapon-making perks working? like there's one science perk that allows crafting laser weapons in utility bench but nothing relevant in it. same with salvage perk that allows disassembly in utility bench


[1/20/2026 11:31 AM] nimshi89
Yeah it doesnt work. I mean I get the xp and all but the NPC says the same


[1/20/2026 11:31 AM] nimshi89
SO I guess that is locked


[1/20/2026 11:32 AM] kazifca
Well, reload a save


[1/20/2026 11:32 AM] kazifca
look online for the quest


[1/20/2026 11:32 AM] kazifca
look under bugs


[1/20/2026 11:32 AM] kazifca
and see if it's vanilla


[1/20/2026 11:32 AM] kazifca
it might have a real solution


[1/20/2026 11:33 AM] nimshi89
okay I will


[1/20/2026 11:35 AM] nimshi89
okay yeah found the issue


[1/20/2026 11:36 AM] nimshi89

go into mcm and set your wheel hotkey


[1/20/2026 11:39 AM] kazifca
way more useful


[1/20/2026 11:40 AM] peanuts1582
You're a legend for helping everyone Kazifca. On that note, how do I actually "learn" power armor training, I'm with the atomcats but do I need to do their quests first?


[1/20/2026 11:40 AM] rud87
I have a thing against radial menus in general


[1/20/2026 11:41 AM] kazifca
Naw bro trust, with MAIM you like really want it


[1/20/2026 11:41 AM] kazifca

[1/20/2026 11:41 AM] rud87

[1/20/2026 11:41 AM] kazifca
The thing that adds all those new medical supplies


[1/20/2026 11:41 AM] rud87

[1/20/2026 11:41 AM] kazifca
Give it a try


[1/20/2026 11:41 AM] kazifca

[1/20/2026 11:42 AM] kazifca
Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh


[1/20/2026 11:42 AM] kazifca
Which mods specifically lmao


[1/20/2026 11:43 AM] rud87
true grass
grass reworked
grasphalts be gone
veldt
patches for above mods


[1/20/2026 11:44 AM] rud87
I kept better landscape grass only


[1/20/2026 11:44 AM] rud87
and pine forest


[1/20/2026 11:44 AM] rud87
I like pines


[1/20/2026 11:44 AM] rud87
on 3070 performance is ass and I wanna keep enb so forgo landscape instead


[1/20/2026 11:44 AM] kazifca
Okay, I'm assuming that's an aesthetic choice over a performance one


[1/20/2026 11:45 AM] kazifca
Oh?


[1/20/2026 11:45 AM] kazifca
HD texture pack disabled?


[1/20/2026 11:45 AM] rud87

[1/20/2026 11:45 AM] kazifca

[1/20/2026 11:45 AM] kazifca

[1/20/2026 11:45 AM] rud87
8


[1/20/2026 11:45 AM] rud87
ah didnt check that but


[1/20/2026 11:46 AM] rud87
I gained around %12-15 fps back


[1/20/2026 11:46 AM] rud87
did a solid comparison tbh


[1/20/2026 11:47 AM] kazifca
Well probably, grass does ultimately take up rendering space, was it locational or constant?


[1/20/2026 11:47 AM] rud87
locational


[1/20/2026 11:47 AM] rud87
completely fine when in concord


[1/20/2026 11:47 AM] likutyr
Hi everyone


[1/20/2026 11:47 AM] rud87
but as soon as I wander it hits prettty bad


[1/20/2026 11:47 AM] kazifca
So everywhere there isn't grass, you chillen?


[1/20/2026 11:48 AM] rud87
seems so


[1/20/2026 11:48 AM] rud87
I would downgrade textures and keep the mods with fine tuning if this was 2016 but im old


[1/20/2026 11:48 AM] rud87
and i just wanna play lol


[1/20/2026 11:48 AM] kazifca
well, valid removal, I have no clue if that'll mess up your precombines or previs at all but I would backup your save before trying to load it just in case


[1/20/2026 11:49 AM] kazifca
Otherwise, run up a new one


[1/20/2026 11:49 AM] rud87
whats a precombine


[1/20/2026 11:49 AM] rud87
lod ?


[1/20/2026 11:49 AM] kazifca
No


[1/20/2026 11:50 AM] kazifca
It's a very long topic that I don't fully understand (yet), but very, very essentially it's a precombined set of meshes, it allows your computer to load multiple things within less draw calls, as opposed to loading each item individually


[1/20/2026 11:51 AM] rud87
right like a type of preloading


[1/20/2026 11:51 AM] rud87
Yeah Ill go with a new save


[1/20/2026 11:51 AM] rud87
Thanks man


[1/20/2026 11:51 AM] rud87
I hope I can change Alt key to Middle mouse click in MCM too

[1/20/2026 1:27 PM] rud87
Its really pain in the ass to test stuff out with this cigarette saving


[1/20/2026 1:27 PM] kazifca
you create an exit save on each exit


[1/20/2026 1:28 PM] kazifca
Or well, should


[1/20/2026 1:28 PM] rud87
I thought so and did that, it did not create one


[1/20/2026 1:28 PM] rud87
now I m back to square 1


[1/20/2026 1:28 PM] kazifca
Weird


[1/20/2026 1:28 PM] rud87
I did mess up wit the ui and would reload anyway but still


[1/20/2026 1:28 PM] rud87
I need a consistent hard save option


[1/20/2026 1:29 PM] kazifca
I mean, idk how re-enable saving, but honestly, I would just cheat a bunch of cigs in for testing


[1/20/2026 1:29 PM] kazifca
or survival packs


[1/20/2026 1:29 PM] rud87
The thing is as an old timer


[1/20/2026 1:29 PM] rud87
I dont trust autosaves anyway


[1/20/2026 1:29 PM] kazifca
help "survival pack" 4


[1/20/2026 1:29 PM] kazifca
Thats a hard save


[1/20/2026 1:29 PM] rud87
Nice one thanks


[1/20/2026 2:19 PM] darklary
I mean if you're wanting to just make test saves, can just GIVE  yourself cigs via the console.


[1/20/2026 2:19 PM] darklary
Or survival packs


[1/20/2026 2:20 PM] darklary
I don't think so? Ghoulish is a thing though.

Can you use the flashlights on weapons somehow or is it just for show?


[1/20/2026 2:25 PM] kazifca
It’s a pop boy flashlight issue


[1/20/2026 2:26 PM] kazifca
Pipboy smfh


[1/20/2026 2:26 PM] kazifca
It overrides flashlights on weapons  super commonly


[1/20/2026 2:33 PM] caughtmedead
Oh okay, so you’re just supposed to use hold tab to turn those on?


[1/20/2026 2:34 PM] kazifca
Yeah


[1/20/2026 2:34 PM] kazifca
The light should be on technically

Gotta get your IRA cleared before that stops


[1/20/2026 3:07 PM] hasjcira
this is from the gas mask mod?


[1/20/2026 3:08 PM] kazifca
No IRA is from DA


[1/20/2026 3:08 PM] kazifca
but it's got a custom system attached so


[1/20/2026 3:08 PM] kazifca
I wouldn't go about removing it


[1/20/2026 3:08 PM] hasjcira
Ca-DTPA works?


[1/20/2026 3:09 PM] kazifca

[1/20/2026 5:28 PM] dallas9911

[1/20/2026 5:41 PM] dallas9911
are you insidea cell


[1/20/2026 5:41 PM] rud87
i built a shack


[1/20/2026 5:41 PM] dallas9911
need a gas mask or an air purifier


[1/20/2026 5:41 PM] rud87
with floors, roof and all


[1/20/2026 5:42 PM] dallas9911
I dont think this has the sheltered mod or what ever


[1/20/2026 5:44 PM] dallas9911
I cant find the mod im talking about on nexus I saw it in lore out but i dont know what its called


[1/20/2026 5:44 PM] rud87
take shelter or somth


[1/20/2026 5:46 PM] dallas9911
yeah i cant find it, I dont think there is a cover system like that in anomaly you can craft the air purifier or just wear a gas mask, there are also a few player homes where you wouldn't need a mask all the time just depends on how much building you want to do


[1/20/2026 5:46 PM] rud87
so sanctuary is not safe whatsoever

[1/20/2026 5:50 PM] dallas9911

Second day of Anomaly and I'm pleasently surprised by how stabile I feel the build is. I mean it's Bethesda and mods and well.. We all know what that can mean.


[1/20/2026 5:51 PM] rud87
alright ill check them out


[1/20/2026 5:51 PM] rud87
is there way to prevent HUD settings getting messed up each time you login


[1/20/2026 5:51 PM] rud87
thanks btw


[1/20/2026 5:52 PM] naggoob
Also tons of fun of course, hehe


[1/20/2026 5:52 PM] naggoob
as a Fallout and Stalker fan since 2007 I feel this is better for me than Stalker 2


[1/20/2026 5:52 PM] dallas9911
check the player homes tab in MO2 if you want more I only know of those from game play


[1/20/2026 5:53 PM] dallas9911
what do you mean?


[1/20/2026 5:55 PM] dallas9911
IF your changing hud settings in the MCM go to the profile and save the changes to the mcm

Hi, my Fallout 4 crashes after about 15 minutes of play. I don't know if there are mods I need to uninstall or...


[1/20/2026 6:11 PM] gachaaddicted
Okay so


[1/20/2026 6:12 PM] gachaaddicted
What do I do to stop myself from dying in those radiation storms??


[1/20/2026 6:12 PM] gachaaddicted
I put on a gas mask but that's easily not enough and I had no place to go fully inside! I tried going into the red rocket place but that still didn't do much.


[1/20/2026 6:22 PM] darklary
Did you just install the modpack, or mods on top of it?


[1/20/2026 6:25 PM] rud87
red rocket player house mod isnt useful with radiation


[1/20/2026 6:25 PM] rud87
it's basically same as being out in the open


[1/20/2026 6:26 PM] gachaaddicted
So I have to go into a building that's completely indoors? Or just any building so long as it can be contained?

If there anyway I can fight off the storm if I'm in the open or is that just it for me?


[1/20/2026 6:26 PM] rud87
make sure your gas mask have a filter on


[1/20/2026 6:26 PM] rud87
I have never been in interiors for hours and still alive


[1/20/2026 6:26 PM] rud87
probably you're missing filters


[1/20/2026 6:27 PM] gachaaddicted
Hmmm I should have a few but I'll see what I can do


[1/20/2026 7:14 PM] qcsurvival

Are zombies supposed to be so tanky? It took two clips of a pistol to bring one down.


[1/20/2026 7:19 PM] gachaaddicted
Same for the chaotic synths and those leaping ones.


[1/20/2026 7:34 PM] darklary
Are you shooting them in the head or body?


[1/20/2026 7:34 PM] darklary
The synths are just quite strong though. Can blow their head off and they'll keep coming.


[1/20/2026 7:35 PM] gachaaddicted
Yea, when it came to the enemies charging on all 4 and leap at you I aim for the heads.

Same for zombies albeit the head or body but still takes a bit.


[1/20/2026 7:36 PM] gachaaddicted
It's got me killed a few times cause I can't go into Concord with them in the way.


[1/20/2026 8:17 PM] darklary
have any grenades?


[1/20/2026 8:23 PM] kazifca
Yes, make sure you shoot them in the head they care little about anything else, if you can't shoot them in the head, bring a shotgun.


[1/20/2026 8:24 PM] kazifca
As I think leonard was gonna lead onto, molotovs & frags are just as strong for you as it is them


[1/20/2026 8:24 PM] kazifca
Well


[1/20/2026 8:24 PM] kazifca
they should be


[1/20/2026 8:24 PM] gachaaddicted
No grenades, at least none that I've found yet. Same with the shotgun. 

I'll just have to keep at it as I can.


[1/20/2026 8:25 PM] kazifca
Check the mailbox by the sanctuary bridge


[1/20/2026 8:25 PM] gachaaddicted
Will do!


[1/20/2026 8:26 PM] kazifca
Makeshift revolving shotgun is ugly as balls, but it's honestly probably one of the best weapons you can find early


[1/20/2026 8:28 PM] gachaaddicted
I'll keep that in mind! I've only got some pipe weapons right now. 

Also! That ATC vehicle. Am I able to put a sleeping back in it? And is it possible for me to close it from the inside or can I only do so outside of it?


[1/20/2026 8:29 PM] kazifca
All of those should be possible with the APC


[1/20/2026 8:29 PM] kazifca
It's only a sleeping bag though


[1/20/2026 8:29 PM] gachaaddicted
Cool. I'll aim to add it into my inventory and place one inside of it.


[1/20/2026 8:30 PM] kazifca
Theres actually an inerent function, top right side, by the corner of the door I think?


[1/20/2026 8:31 PM] kazifca
right looking in towards concord from redrocket


[1/20/2026 8:51 PM] gachaaddicted
It's there. I manage to open it! Just can't seem to find a means to close it from the inside. 

Also an icon question. What does the pill looking symbol mean? It was yellow and now it's red.


[1/20/2026 8:51 PM] kazifca
Open your pipboy, status category, look around in the tabs for like 'active effects'


[1/20/2026 8:52 PM] kazifca

performance / fps tips for getting 70+ fps with 3070rtx

if anyone searches for it in future

bethini
shadows resolution **1024**
godrays **low**
Lens flare **disable**

truegrass.ini
grass size - **70 **

MO2
remove **veldt **and it's patches/variants

ENB
detailed shadow quality **low**
ssao quality **low**
reflections and variants **OFF**
water **off**

enblocal.ini
**improvereflections=false**

For Rework, borealis and probably a forest, for my shit, borealis and some tree mod I make


[1/21/2026 10:02 AM] kazifca
I don't think a pine forest is in the pack, this mod has been taken down for awhile now iirc, Borealis adds pines trees


[1/21/2026 10:02 AM] kazifca
Not in mine, and mine is I think 4 updates out, so I haven't seen any mention of major landscape changes from eizer

Run back there, take a SS, and throw it in here

how do I safely remove A Pine Forest tho


[1/21/2026 10:45 AM] rud87
I dont care the LODs but removing the modbasically breaks my game


[1/21/2026 10:47 AM] kazifca
I included the precombines patches so


[1/21/2026 10:47 AM] kazifca
you'll probably wanna look for that too and remove it


[1/21/2026 10:48 AM] rud87
there is no Borealis but Pinr forest redone


[1/21/2026 10:48 AM] rud87

[1/21/2026 10:49 AM] kazifca
Anyways thats the forest mod tho

[1/21/2026 12:59 PM] dallas9911
oh I see, I miss read


[1/21/2026 1:05 PM] darklary
quick question before I break my game. I wanted to add the extra texture packs to one of the cross armor packs. Where do I put that?


[1/21/2026 1:06 PM] kazifca
Under the cross armor, probably before any bodyslide overrides if there is one


[1/21/2026 1:14 PM] darklary
yeah, you were right. Just right on into the Cross armor pack's main folder.


[1/21/2026 1:35 PM] darklary
also, in regards to what someone was saying earlier, swan does seem to just...break when you kill him.


[1/21/2026 1:35 PM] darklary
He launches up into the sky forever, and phases in and out of reality.


[1/21/2026 1:38 PM] darklary
with the use of ultra jet and diving at him as you kill him you can MASH f to loot everything before he goes to space.


[1/21/2026 1:59 PM] simmic1945
So how do you make weapons from scratch as a workbench? have the perks but it just goes to modify existing weapons.


[1/21/2026 2:00 PM] dallas9911
I want the Exo suit back power armors lame


[1/21/2026 2:01 PM] darklary
you need to make the engineering workbench, and from there you can unlock new benches. Including armor/weapon crafting benches.

[1/21/2026 4:34 PM] caughtmedead
Hell yeah, I just installed it, the pip boy unfortunately covers it up so I think I need the Pip-Pad mod to remove the wrist-mounted pip boy to see it. I'll try to get it working and let you know how it goes

[1/21/2026 5:20 PM] daninjah
didn't see that option in mcm tbh, it might be a Survival difficulty limitation.  smoking ciggies allows for extra save and they're kinda ubiquitous. found a pack in the vault


[1/21/2026 5:20 PM] daninjah
there was one in the pack... 😄


[1/21/2026 5:20 PM] clique420

one of the shift-f2 through shift-f5, don't remember which, i remapped it but these are defaults


[1/21/2026 5:27 PM] daninjah
there are items in aid like 'gasmask wipe' so you can map it to the usual 1-9

[1/21/2026 6:26 PM] shoebim_
Hi everyone! I have a question. In the mod pack, do they have any new housing items for the settlements? Because when I'm in Sanctuary, I only have building items and vanilla furniture (sure, I have a couple of new turrets, but I'm not that interested in them...). Do I need to level up anything special to access them? Do I need to activate something? Or does the mod pack just not include much new housing content?

PS: Sorry for my English... I'm French...


[1/21/2026 7:17 PM] qcsurvival
What should I do if it says I'm infected by radiation?


[1/21/2026 7:32 PM] karlious

Is your HD texture pack disabled?


[1/21/2026 10:39 PM] _bighoss
Yeh I dont even own it, its such a weird issue because if I start a new character, apply mcm settings leave the vault and play it out I have a steady 60fps


[1/21/2026 10:40 PM] _bighoss
But if I leave, close the app and reload the game thats when the game suddenly just runs terrible with nothing changed


[1/21/2026 10:41 PM] _bighoss
Disabling graphics settings doesnt boost the fps

[1/21/2026 10:45 PM] kazifca
Not a clue


[1/21/2026 10:45 PM] _bighoss
Yeah idk but the main culprit is me closing the app and relaunching


[1/21/2026 10:46 PM] kazifca
no added mods?


[1/21/2026 10:46 PM] _bighoss
Something about that just nukes fps


[1/21/2026 10:46 PM] _bighoss
No


[1/21/2026 10:46 PM] kazifca

[1/22/2026 10:29 AM] darklary
Whats the verdict on that pipboy mod?


[1/22/2026 10:34 AM] darklary
best advice I can give you is invest skill points into medicine and craft the CA yellow rad stims as often as you can. Moniter your rads like you're monitering REAL radiation levels (Check every couple minutes on the rad boy to ensure you're not building them up too much.) And, if you EVER reach like 100 rads or more, pop a stim. As long as you keep the rads you've consumed within the "Safe" range, you're SUPER unlikely to actaully get rad poisoning. 
Investing in survival and picking up lead belly/rad resistant can also help a great deal. You will level up rather frequently in this mod pack, so don't be shy with levels.


[1/22/2026 10:51 AM] naggoob
I was wondering if there is anyway to adjust AP when sneaking or disable that function? I was looking trough mod menu but didn't find anything that seemed to be about that function


[1/22/2026 10:51 AM] darklary
If theres a way to turn it off, it'd be in the MCM under the mod that adds it. Which mod that is, I am not sure.


[1/22/2026 11:24 AM] darklary
If I were to try and manuall add the boston riot armor, would I want the BA2 or ESL version?

I got it working after a couple hours of trouble shooting - I had to download the previous version of the garmin mod, without the gadgets of the zone dependency because for some reason it made my game stutter every 5 seconds. Then, to disable the project arroyo pip boy 2000 mod I had to make an edit to Anomaly Complex Loader to get rid of the project arroyo dependency (doesn’t break anything that I’ve noticed so far) and add in either the other pip boy 2000 mod that is hand held, or the pip pad mod to free up the slot on the wrist for the garmin. Played for like 2 hours or so last night after that and it seemed good.

[1/22/2026 3:05 PM] darklary
on the roof of the museum in concord in the crashed vertibird next to the intro set is a tape of power armor training. You'll get a pop up when you pick it up with a lead on where to get training to wear power armor.

wabbajack does that automatically while installing


[1/22/2026 3:18 PM] rud87
you wouldn't have all these pre 980 mods work with f4se otherwise

1. No

I have a settlement quest here, and the npc I'm supposed to talk to in order to start it, is a RABBIT


[1/22/2026 7:16 PM] darklary

[1/22/2026 7:17 PM] darklary
I don't know what to do about this one boys, I think covenant is gonna have to fend for itself this time. lol

[1/22/2026 7:21 PM] sovietwardog

[1/22/2026 7:36 PM] darklary

[1/22/2026 7:36 PM] darklary
Or, are you bleeding real bad?


[1/22/2026 7:46 PM] perinthia
is it normal for all your settlers to be hostile to the enclave? whenever i try to take an enclave vertibird into my settlement it opens fire on me

Anyone know how to adjust my characters breathing sound volume? I'm slightly deaf and the audio from that is drowning out literally everythign else for me


[1/22/2026 7:58 PM] frogonalogiamzog
So I checked my rad boy and it says my levels are safe but I still somehow keep getting radiation poisioning and im not sure how


[1/22/2026 8:00 PM] mr.azai
apparently its an audio glitch


[1/22/2026 8:13 PM] frogonalogiamzog

[1/22/2026 9:46 PM] ludens_001
Aight, I did something kinda dumb, not sure what but I cannot start Anomaly up. My greed for tactical gear might have done it in.


[1/22/2026 10:24 PM] ludens_001
I'll leave it here if anyone might have a solution (even if it's just "Yeah no you're borked.")  I installed a Tac Surplus modpack, full of all new gucci gear. If I activate it, game CTDs after the ENB screen. If I don't, things work just swell. Anyone else have any issues with that? Not looking for official support since the warranty was voided by my greed, but I just really, really want that backpack filter set-up for all my larp purposes.


[1/22/2026 11:33 PM] sushiburp
can anyone tell me how to fix my broken leg im about to just entirely uninstall this mod pack, i used every single IFAK/Splint/Stimpak i had and it did nothign for my leg

[1/23/2026 2:49 AM] caughtmedead
in the console do help "cleansing tonic" it should list all entries with that name then just have to find the actual game object and enter that ID


[1/23/2026 2:50 AM] caughtmedead
Actually it only lists the one Lol

[1/23/2026 8:12 AM] mothquebec
kinda stuck


[1/23/2026 8:16 AM] mothquebec
even tried the cheat menu portable


[1/23/2026 8:36 AM] frogonalogiamzog
You need to do a cleansing liquid and a mut away I think is what its called


[1/23/2026 8:36 AM] frogonalogiamzog
and check your IRA too


[1/23/2026 8:36 AM] frogonalogiamzog
Might aswell just take a cleansing liquid, mutaway, and refreshing drink


[1/23/2026 8:36 AM] frogonalogiamzog
and that should fix your character


[1/23/2026 8:43 AM] mothquebec

not being able to cook adhesives from the git go is atrocious. people are ripping each other's throats for a roll of silver tape. anyone knows how many points in survival is needed for the recipe to pop up? 15 just gives you baked tatos. roleplaying a science nerd but it's useless without the precious glue


[1/23/2026 9:54 AM] kazifca
Comport crofter?


[1/23/2026 9:54 AM] kazifca
It’s a perk

Compost crofter*


[1/23/2026 9:54 AM] kazifca
Or sumn like that, in survival


[1/23/2026 10:50 AM] peanuts1582
you need to equip your gas mask and filter


[1/23/2026 10:56 AM] caughtmedead
Did you ever figure this out? Was thinking of starting the quest line


[1/23/2026 10:57 AM] kazifca
To make your & everyone's life easier before I tug away at mapping again:
If you don't the know the command to search for ID's
help "item name" 4 
4 narrow's down the ID's, then you can write something like:
help "item name" 4 AMMO/ARMO/WEAP/ALCH
to further cut down the list of ID's filtered by the help function specifically to the type of ID you're looking for. 
help "riot optics controller" 4 (my item name could be wrong for sure) for example, doesn't have any attachments so your command won't get bloated with OMODS.
Not always the case, work on a per item basis when you need to look for one.


[1/23/2026 10:59 AM] peanuts1582
There should be a FAQ in this server, with QOL tips like this one and how radiation, crafting etc works for new players


[1/23/2026 11:00 AM] kazifca
Yeah, eventually, I have a lot of stuff to do, FFR has to get a complete landscape before I can work on more general tasks

[1/23/2026 11:03 AM] kazifca

[1/23/2026 11:03 AM] kazifca
like clean or updating?


[1/23/2026 11:07 AM] kazifca
I'm pretty sure you can still make sure of the website, downgrading is automatic


[1/23/2026 11:07 AM] kazifca

[1/23/2026 11:12 AM] naggoob
The documents needed for the workbenches like ammo bench, are those tied to quest or just found in some unknown locations?


[1/23/2026 11:14 AM] kazifca
I honestly couldn't tell you, I've had 30 tabs of maps and topographical software open for the past week. I can take a gander on github though and see what you're seeing tho

Schematics? you make them at the engineering bench, need overdue books

Ammo bench requires ammo to make the schematic, not overdue books iirc

Anyone have or know of the issue where smoking a cigarette does the stimpak heal animation?


[1/23/2026 11:37 AM] darklary
yeah, i've seen that in several peoples games that I know.


[1/23/2026 11:38 AM] darklary
it's been brought up here before.


[1/23/2026 11:39 AM] darklary
from earlier: I think I figured it out. If you want the cigarette animation to play each time, put your weapon away, and use the cigarette from the radial menu H


[1/23/2026 11:39 AM] bitablack69
appreciate it just wanted to make sure it wasnt my end

They don’t die in one shot to the head? Did you apply the MCM preset after you picked up the pip boy?


[1/23/2026 3:19 PM] dallas9911
My Ap is --/-- and it doesnt regen Idk when it started but idk how to fix


[1/23/2026 3:29 PM] dallas9911
ok, its the plates I have 8 jug plates effect active


[1/23/2026 3:30 PM] oxtrem
Correct even after applying the preset normal zombies and even low tier raiders are tanks I can’t even make it to the museum of freedom without running out of ammo or dying


[1/23/2026 3:49 PM] dallas9911
anyone have a fix for the armor plates effects stacking in have -6 agility and 0ap


[1/23/2026 3:50 PM] kazifca
Get shot


[1/23/2026 3:51 PM] kazifca
Don’t they appear in your armor section?


[1/23/2026 4:03 PM] .robo_
anyone have any tweaks for grenades? I basically see the icon and think "Yep I'm dead."

They seem to not factor in verticality, cover, or a reasonable distance. If you're standing on an overpass and a frag blows up beneath you, you die regardless of how far you are vertically


[1/23/2026 4:05 PM] .robo_
atp I'm considering just looking for something that removes them entirely. I 1 shot swan with a frag lol


[1/23/2026 4:25 PM] oxtrem
how do we reenable saving early game shit is rough and honestly annoying wiith how easy it is to die im still trying to learn alll the mods lmfao


[1/23/2026 4:27 PM] caughtmedead
Sleeping or smoking cigs will save the game, you can find plenty in concord I had about 25 before I got to the museum


[1/23/2026 4:27 PM] oxtrem
lmfao wish i knew about the cigs lmfao

Sorry for being a bother but im crashing with no logs. Any ideas whats wrong?


[1/23/2026 5:10 PM] kazifca
You’re gonna have to provide more details then that


[1/23/2026 5:11 PM] kazifca
Is it consistent?


[1/23/2026 5:11 PM] kazifca
Do you reach x area and it happens


[1/23/2026 5:12 PM] kazifca
Are you sliding a bunch then crashing?


[1/23/2026 5:12 PM] kazifca
Or is it like a post ENB load crash


[1/23/2026 5:29 PM] .kingpluto
Do you need to keep dirty filter


[1/23/2026 5:29 PM] .kingpluto
or do you just throw them away?


[1/23/2026 5:36 PM] jackson21a
Well the first time i was walking towards a group of gunners and supermutants and it would always crash when i got close so i went a differnt route and it was working fine for a while till i was walking towards the slog and crashed a few times until it suddenly worked. And i have no crashlogs from what i can see so i have no idea where to start.


[1/23/2026 5:37 PM] kazifca
Jumping/Sliding a lot in that process? There's a thing with enhanced movement's slide that can very occasionally cause a crash


[1/23/2026 5:39 PM] jackson21a
No im just walking i swear its something to do with enemies because at the slog too i heard a fight going on not too far away and i suddenly crash until the load where i dont hear any fights.


[1/23/2026 5:39 PM] kazifca
you're all good, just gotta be inquisitive


[1/23/2026 5:39 PM] kazifca
Did you add any mods?


[1/23/2026 5:39 PM] jackson21a
No


[1/23/2026 5:40 PM] jackson21a
I made a support ticket with the earalier crash and put a save with it if that helps


[1/23/2026 5:41 PM] kazifca
Okay, you're in the F4SE file when you're looking for logs?


[1/23/2026 5:44 PM] darklary

[1/23/2026 5:55 PM] kazifca
Well, are they crash logs? if so, you can try moving them into CLASSIC's folders and re runing the scan

[1/23/2026 10:06 PM] jackson21a
I think i figured it out I found the crash logs and i think it has something to do with supermutants. It advised i download a patch so im going to try that.


[1/24/2026 12:15 AM] decstock

Is it possible to just disable True Damage and Scourge via MO2 and play this list without them? And can this be done on a somewhat early-game save?


[1/24/2026 1:25 AM] kazifca
Both settings should be in MO2


[1/24/2026 1:26 AM] kazifca
LOL


[1/24/2026 1:26 AM] kazifca

MCM


[1/24/2026 1:26 AM] kazifca
that was dense of me omg


[1/24/2026 1:26 AM] urukage
Thank you for the quick reply. If they are disabled on an existing save (barely getting to Concorde after some gearing), should that save be safe to continue playing?


[1/24/2026 1:27 AM] kazifca
I would keep them enabled in MO2 for any odd custom scripts that would be kicking around, and shut them off in MCM to be extra safe cause they have that option, but I would think it's more than safe that route


[1/24/2026 1:28 AM] urukage
Awesome, thank you. I see the troubles that True Damage has been causing (and have experienced it). Modding is such a PITA sometimes. haha Appreciate your work though.

[1/24/2026 1:30 AM] kazifca
It's easier to just edit the numbers


[1/24/2026 1:30 AM] kazifca
gun damage and ammo is additive so it seems


[1/24/2026 1:31 AM] kazifca
No reason to multiply it by 10x

[1/24/2026 2:36 AM] decstock
Is the gas mask mod mandatory or no


[1/24/2026 2:36 AM] decstock
I like it but I love the idea of not using it if it get to anyone


[1/24/2026 2:36 AM] decstock
Annoying


[1/24/2026 2:37 AM] kazifca
You can turn it off in MCM

now I wished I had a save everywhere... as much Im having fun there is frustrating bugs, example now I went back to vault 111 to collect junk I left and game froze.


[1/24/2026 7:29 AM] skully_152.
how do you get the crafting journal for making ammo bench??


[1/24/2026 8:23 AM] jeandenaoded
does sleeping heal crippled body part?


[1/24/2026 10:23 AM] darklary
engineering bench has recipes for bench blueprints.


[1/24/2026 10:24 AM] darklary
You'll need crafting journals, which are made at the same bench and cost overdue books.


[1/24/2026 10:38 AM] likutyr
I could use some help, I can't open Bethini, there's something wrong with the path


[1/24/2026 10:39 AM] likutyr
System can't find path "apps/"


[1/24/2026 10:56 AM] naggoob
Don't know if this is a known issue or just a me issue but raiders with merc veteran armor don't seem to equip it (running around in their undies, possible hats and armor pieces)


[1/24/2026 11:08 AM] likutyr
fixed it, needed to run it not from search in file explorer, but by opening the file location and running it there


[1/24/2026 12:31 PM] caughtmedead
Bump


[1/24/2026 12:31 PM] caughtmedead
I replied to Eizers fix for this, it stopped the naked raiders due to the merc veteran but still some people spawn naked even though they have armor


[1/24/2026 12:32 PM] caughtmedead
@Naggoob this is what you want


[1/24/2026 2:21 PM] fhearanyakki
hum... is normal when using cigarettes it does stimpack animation? shouldnt have a smoke one? Or Im missing something😅


[1/24/2026 2:33 PM] bitablack69
Try having your gun holstered then smoking one through the wheel using H


[1/24/2026 2:33 PM] bitablack69
Not how intended but a little solution


[1/24/2026 2:41 PM] naggoob
@caughtmedead  the Eisers Robco patches is in the loadorder and the raider running around in the undies have the merc veteran armor in the invent but not equipt. Is the linked Eizers patches a newer one, a fixed fix?


[1/24/2026 2:47 PM] fhearanyakki
I'll check next save thanks!


[1/24/2026 3:05 PM] aceisbased.
does anyone know if you can use bodyslide in this mod pack, I discovered it last night while changing my character's face. after doing some research im confused if you need to create a new mod for the output of those files.


[1/24/2026 3:49 PM] caughtmedead
Yeah it's an updated one, not perfect still some naked people like I said but it did eliminate the merc armor naked bug


[1/24/2026 3:59 PM] blindindark
How can i unbug my gun with true damage if it does almost 0 damage ?

In the open world especially, interiors are buttery smooth though


[1/24/2026 4:25 PM] bitablack69
yeah im even using lossless and it's still a bit of an issue


[1/24/2026 4:47 PM] _bighoss
close the app then rejoin


[1/24/2026 4:47 PM] _bighoss

[1/24/2026 5:06 PM] daninjah
weird bug with ballistic weapons getting super high dmg for some reason. like 324 on uzi, while the usual is 30-something. around 600 on deagle lol. energy weapons are a-ok


[1/24/2026 5:07 PM] daninjah
remember having very low dmg instead in the beginning of this run, like 3dmg on 10mm pistol


[1/24/2026 5:07 PM] daninjah
restarting seems to help


[1/24/2026 5:08 PM] brothernurgle
hey guys i just started the game and my pip boy isnt showing up when i press tab after i picked it up off the ground, any ideas?


[1/24/2026 5:09 PM] brothernurgle
also im still in the vault but if i open mcm it just freezes


[1/24/2026 5:09 PM] daninjah
first mcm load takes a lot of time, might want to wait it out


[1/24/2026 5:10 PM] daninjah
maybe same with the pip boy, scripts take a lot of time to fire off in the first time. some start after you exit the vault


[1/24/2026 5:11 PM] brothernurgle
alright ill get out the vault and just let it run then


[1/24/2026 5:14 PM] chaptermaster_kaelveydran

I get the radiation warning for the storm and I don't actually take much damage from it


[1/24/2026 7:26 PM] theazelotus
so I'd say mask not necessary

okay i am so confused apparently the thing that was causing my game to crash wasnt the armor mod but instead x-cell.... a performance mod......WHAT!!!


[1/24/2026 7:43 PM] caughtmedead
Jump keybind is underneath TogglePOV/Workshop keybind and above Sprint keybind


[1/24/2026 7:44 PM] caughtmedead
If you don't see it between those two something major is probably going on Lol

how do I go about getting meat from animals? I've increased zoology to 30 thinking that would help


[1/25/2026 12:39 AM] nomad5157
@Anomaly Support how do I go about getting meat from animals?


[1/25/2026 12:39 AM] Anomaly Support#5100
To get meat from animals, you need to butcher them using either a **Knife** or a **Blowtorch** that is in your inventory.


[1/25/2026 12:39 AM] naggoob
oh,, thanks


[1/25/2026 12:59 AM] naggoob
okey, I have a bowie knife equipt but still can't butcher this radstag. I've checked and can't find any butcher related skills to choose


[1/25/2026 1:13 AM] naggoob
@Anomaly Support what type of knife is needed to get meat from an animal


[1/25/2026 1:13 AM] Anomaly Support#5100
To butcher animals for meat and hide, you need a **Knife** or **Blowtorch** in your inventory. The type of knife is not specified, so any knife should be sufficient.


[1/25/2026 1:14 AM] nomad5157
Take a look at https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/48853 we also have a keybind for it in the mcm but I do not recall what it is right now. You can look in the hotkey section and it should let you kknow

Hey how would one disable the save and auto save mechanic where you need cigarettes or the survival pack


[1/25/2026 2:52 AM] decstock
Which mod is that


[1/25/2026 2:52 AM] decstock
It seems intresting but maybe to hard core


[1/25/2026 2:59 AM] decstock
Let me know when ever


[1/25/2026 3:20 AM] Anomaly Support#5100
The provided context does not contain information on how to disable the save and auto-save mechanic. It only explains how to save the game using cigarettes or sleeping. If you're looking to modify or disable this feature, I recommend reaching out to the staff team through the official channels, such as the Discord server, for further assistance. They may be able to provide you with more information or guidance on how to achieve this.


[1/25/2026 3:21 AM] nomad5157
Not really at this moment

No mod I can just axe for right now n


[1/25/2026 3:23 AM] nomad5157
No, it's a baked in system


[1/25/2026 3:25 AM] Anomaly Support#5100
According to the provided context, there is no information on removing mods. However, it does mention that adding mods is "Not recommended" as it voids support in the Discord. If you need further assistance, I would guide you to reach out to the staff team for more information. You can report or ask questions using the slash command `/report @User Reason` or ask in the designated channel, and the staff will help you privately.

Disregard that timeout was just testing the bot


[1/25/2026 4:09 AM] naggoob
@Anomaly Support is zoology important for getting meat from animals


[1/25/2026 4:10 AM] naggoob
worth a try, lol


[1/25/2026 4:11 AM] nomad5157
you have to do /ask now nag, but it doesnt have info on that lol


[1/25/2026 4:11 AM] Anomaly Support#5100
According to the provided context, specifically the "Butchering and Hunting" section in the [Doc: gameplay-faq.md] file, to butcher animals for meat and hide, you need a **Knife** or **Blowtorch** in your inventory. There is no mention of zoology being required for this process.


[1/25/2026 4:12 AM] Anomaly Support#5100
If Wabbajack fails to download the ENB, you can download it manually from [enbdev.com](http://enbdev.com/mod_fallout4_v0501.htm) and place the zip (DO NOT EXTRACT) into your Wabbajack **Downloads** folder.

So, I applied the MCM preset, but the Kimber Custom still does only 3 damage. Does anyone have a fix?


[1/25/2026 5:59 AM] nomad5157
When in doubt make a save and reload. Usually once you get in combat it will correct itself


[1/25/2026 6:11 AM] likutyr
It took me restarting the whole game, not just reloading the save, but it got fixed. Thanks!

They should be craftable, and you can find them as rare loot iirc, found a lot in subway trash cans in my playthroughs, someone mentioned one of the vaults having a placement, maybe 81?


[1/25/2026 9:48 AM] kazifca
Eventually they pop up


[1/25/2026 9:48 AM] theazelotus
I see


[1/25/2026 9:48 AM] theazelotus
I don't have enough science to craft one


[1/25/2026 9:49 AM] theazelotus
and I can't find/buy any or find a broken one


[1/25/2026 9:49 AM] darklary
Uhhh...I think I found one saving nick.


[1/25/2026 9:49 AM] theazelotus
In the vault?


[1/25/2026 9:49 AM] darklary
Yeah


[1/25/2026 9:49 AM] theazelotus
Any idea where?


[1/25/2026 9:49 AM] theazelotus
I might backtrack


[1/25/2026 9:50 AM] kazifca
Do you need drinks or purified water?


[1/25/2026 9:50 AM] kazifca
for like meds


[1/25/2026 9:51 AM] theazelotus
I mean I suppose I don't need it tbh but it's for sustinance more than anything


[1/25/2026 9:51 AM] theazelotus
I'd like a sustainable source


[1/25/2026 9:52 AM] kazifca
Well, they'll produce dirty water unless Eizer has changed that in one of the last few updates, which could be the case I've been out of it.


[1/25/2026 9:53 AM] kazifca
Are you on immersive crafting?


[1/25/2026 9:53 AM] theazelotus
Should I check the mod config?


[1/25/2026 9:53 AM] theazelotus
I would not know


[1/25/2026 9:53 AM] kazifca
May wanna take a look at immersive water purification if so, couldn't find the water table otherwise


[1/25/2026 9:53 AM] kazifca
Well, do you need schmatics to learn stuff?


[1/25/2026 9:54 AM] theazelotus
No I don't think so


[1/25/2026 9:54 AM] theazelotus
I just need to have the right science or other skill and it passively gives me the ability to craft


[1/25/2026 9:55 AM] kazifca
it should be under resources > water, but it never popped up for me in that mode of crafting

Hey yall, got a quick question about far harbor. After leaving the first town and being in the fog for a few minutes i drop dead with full health and no effects that would kill me. Is this a festure of the modpack? And if so how do i avoid dying in the fog? I apologize if this is answered already somewhere else, thanks!


[1/25/2026 11:01 AM] darklary
Are you wearing a gasmask?


[1/25/2026 11:02 AM] nelson5091
Yes


[1/25/2026 11:02 AM] darklary
rads aren't built up super high? Like if you check with rad boy?


[1/25/2026 11:04 AM] nelson5091
Nope, i just had a doc remove all rads and i am get <1 rads constantly in the fog its not enough to show up on the bar


[1/25/2026 11:04 AM] darklary
That is really weird. I'm not encountering this, although I'm a version or two behind you.


[1/25/2026 11:05 AM] darklary
That might be a bug, unless someone comes in with the reason behind it.


[1/25/2026 11:05 AM] darklary
or, how far into the fog are you pushing?


[1/25/2026 11:06 AM] darklary
I've mostly stayed near the edges of the map. Along the coast, maybe it gets super lethal in pockets deeper in.


[1/25/2026 11:06 AM] nelson5091
Im following longfellow and usually die after the first group of trappers, i did a test run where i stood right outside the condensers and it took about 5 mins for me to die


[1/25/2026 11:07 AM] darklary
I think I might head to far harbor, see if I can replicate this.

Hey guys, my legs got into bad condition from being overweight, I unloaded before they broke, but then they continued to break anyway
I splinted them and went to sleep, woke up and they broke again
Im not sure if this is a bug or I'm doing something wrong


[1/25/2026 12:44 PM] darklary
No, you should be able to use them as often as you want.


[1/25/2026 12:44 PM] darklary
do you have any bleeds?


[1/25/2026 12:45 PM] brothernurgle
I don't see anything in my effects tab that would say that


[1/25/2026 12:45 PM] x4vi6r
okay jw bc i used one and it didnt save i thought maybe there's a timer


[1/25/2026 12:48 PM] brothernurgle
Is there a tab specifically to check if you're bleeding?


[1/25/2026 1:13 PM] darklary
Shouldn't be, no. It takes like, a second or two after smoking to save for me. Keep me posted on that though.


[1/25/2026 1:14 PM] darklary
Not exactly? Maim is what's responsible for the bleeds. Should have symbols in the top right or left maybe bottom left?


[1/25/2026 1:14 PM] darklary
If you aren't sure, and suspect you might be, i recomend just using a bandage or tx stim.

[1/25/2026 1:14 PM] darklary
Ah, I THINK that's contusion?


[1/25/2026 1:15 PM] darklary
I believe med-ex fixes that.


[1/25/2026 1:15 PM] darklary
If you're limbs aren't crippled, Ibuprophen will heal limbs.


[1/25/2026 1:34 PM] jackson21a
Hey any body have any idea what’s wrong I’m crashing when I leave the cell green tech is in. Or well I wish it was a crash the games just freezing with background noise continuing.


[1/25/2026 2:07 PM] perinthia

MO2 have AFT Plus but in game I dont see any holotape or MCM? Also I though you could save someone with curie but when I go there nothing happen.


[1/25/2026 2:33 PM] darklary
Ah yeah, I've seen that lol.


[1/25/2026 2:34 PM] darklary
sometimes a gunner will have just...ALL the ammo


[1/25/2026 2:34 PM] darklary
I usually leave it on them, and then use a bowie knife to 'dispose' of the body to get rid of the comical amount of ammo.


[1/25/2026 2:42 PM] rushedtempo

easiest way i know is join the brotherhood on the prydwyn


[1/25/2026 2:46 PM] nomad5157
Believe thats caused by an old bug with one of the laser rifle mods


[1/25/2026 2:47 PM] rushedtempo
ah okay so technically first Minutemen quest is softlocked?


[1/25/2026 2:47 PM] perinthia
you dont need the power armor for the minute man quest, just kill everyone without it

hey what's the rule of thumb to build a shelter ? It seems none of them work in rad storms and even sanctuary airtight rooms dont


[1/25/2026 3:05 PM] caughtmedead
I think there is an air purifier settlement object


[1/25/2026 3:06 PM] caughtmedead
None of the buildings by themselves will stop the rads, only the purifier I believe


[1/25/2026 3:13 PM] nomad5157
Yeah it's kinda janky but the purifier should help

[1/25/2026 3:14 PM] jackson21a
Any ideas on how to fix the game freezing and not crashing?


[1/25/2026 3:16 PM] nomad5157
Make sure you follow all the steps on our website, meet all the requirements, and have a generally good running PC with not a lot of bloat running. I've seen people with laptops, streamers etc run hours or days without crashing so it really depends on your PC. If there is an area that crashes that you can repeat constantly then let us know


[1/25/2026 3:17 PM] jackson21a
Yeah im right in the middle of my playthrough and when i go a certain distance away from greentech i freeze and oddly enough i still hear sounds.


[1/25/2026 3:18 PM] nomad5157
Sounds like a memory fault crash


[1/25/2026 3:18 PM] nomad5157
If you have a crash log you can post in https://discord.com/channels/1113971680419782666/1436437500666187867

[1/25/2026 3:20 PM] perinthia
What bridge?


[1/25/2026 3:20 PM] darklary
Same here, man. Same here. lol

Actually I never liked in Sanctuary anyway


[1/25/2026 3:20 PM] rud87
Any cool settlements to make my main and only, any suggestios ?


[1/25/2026 3:22 PM] perinthia

[1/25/2026 3:27 PM] jackson21a
i think you can clean them, or recycle them for aluminum.


[1/25/2026 3:34 PM] londonnnb
could anyone help me with the download?


[1/25/2026 3:34 PM] perinthia
what settlement does everyone use as their main? i was planning to use spectacle island and just ues enclave vertibirds to travel to and from it, but then found out my settlers are hostile to the enclave


[1/25/2026 3:35 PM] perinthia
have you downgraded your game?


[1/25/2026 3:35 PM] londonnnb

am i supposed to?


[1/25/2026 3:38 PM] caughtmedead
Will installing GCM overwrite any custom changes made by the mod? I need to add it, as the current power armor durability slit my immersions throat, dumped the body in the river, only for the gulper from the TV Show to swallow it whole.


[1/25/2026 3:39 PM] caughtmedead
In other words, I really need to increase the dura xD


[1/25/2026 3:40 PM] perinthia
Yes, this modlist uses an older version of fallout


[1/25/2026 3:41 PM] londonnnb
can you show me how?


[1/25/2026 3:41 PM] perinthia
There should be guides in the support page


[1/25/2026 3:43 PM] caughtmedead
Its automatic through the wabbajack launcher

[1/25/2026 3:51 PM] fhearanyakki
In the past I used a lot vault dlc settlement but then always used the home in DC, they are instance rooms so you dont need to worry of rads, raining and all the shit (DC dont even need to worry of enemies and settlers too)... but of course they are way to limited with building pieces. Eh I don't really have a favorite one, lets say the castle and jamaica plain if I would... and Red Rocket in nuka world...


[1/25/2026 3:57 PM] perinthia
unless they fixed it quite recently, wabbajack's auto downgrader is broken and you have to do in manually


[1/25/2026 4:19 PM] londonnnb
how do i manually change it>


[1/25/2026 4:19 PM] londonnnb

Can anyone help me with this problem I'm having, I'm about 99% done with the downloads but this one file ccbgsfo4046-tescan.esl refuses to download for me, I've restarted my pc and retried the download dozens of times but nothing seems to work.


[1/25/2026 4:39 PM] jackson21a
Did you delete the specific file? Sometimes it gets stuck.


[1/25/2026 4:41 PM] chaptermaster_kaelveydran
It seems to be pointing to (GameFileSourceDownloader+State|Fallout4|1.11.191.0|data\ccbgsfo4046-tescan.esl) I don't know where that is lol


[1/25/2026 4:42 PM] jackson21a
I think cc has to do with creation club content


[1/25/2026 4:43 PM] chaptermaster_kaelveydran
Yeah tescan is the Tesla Cannon CC stuff


[1/25/2026 4:44 PM] chaptermaster_kaelveydran
What's also weird is that file is apparently already in the data folder of the base game, Should I delete that file to see if anything works?


[1/25/2026 4:48 PM] x4vi6r
idk if itll work but when i was downloading it i couldn't get certain game files until i went into steam and verified fallout 4's file integrity.

That could work but do you think that might screw with the downloads?


[1/25/2026 4:49 PM] x4vi6r
no it wont mess with the downloads


[1/25/2026 4:49 PM] chaptermaster_kaelveydran

As far as anyone know is there any way to get legendary microchips in game? or is that something that can only be spawned in (i spawned 1 in just to test something)

[1/25/2026 4:53 PM] brothernurgle
the ammo workbench tells me i need the Technician perk to craft energy ammo, but I dont even see that perk in the list, i took backyard batteries but I dont even see where to craft with that


[1/25/2026 4:53 PM] chaptermaster_kaelveydran
I think that's a similar mechanic to Fallout 76 where you scrap legendary items to get the chips, I could be wrong though but try spawning a random legendary then scrapping it to see if anything gets added


[1/25/2026 4:54 PM] perinthia
il give that a try, i saw there are actual perks required to craft some of the legendary effects, so i figure there is a way to actually get them somehow


[1/25/2026 4:55 PM] chaptermaster_kaelveydran
Certainly seems like there's a way to get them, Try doing both and see if anything changes


[1/25/2026 4:55 PM] perinthia
you are correct, thats how you get them


[1/25/2026 4:56 PM] chaptermaster_kaelveydran
Ah glad to hear it 😄


[1/25/2026 4:56 PM] perinthia
the next thing i have to figure out is how to rank up the skill "Legendary Specialist" lol


[1/25/2026 4:56 PM] chaptermaster_kaelveydran
Makes sense since that's how 76 does it so modded Fo4 would probably do the same


[1/25/2026 4:57 PM] chaptermaster_kaelveydran
Hah well I hope you figure that out lol


[1/25/2026 4:58 PM] perinthia
ah well for anyone else wondering, only way to rank it up is by finding rare magazines scattered across the game


[1/25/2026 4:58 PM] chaptermaster_kaelveydran
Ahh


[1/25/2026 5:00 PM] londonnnb
i still cant figure this out i downgraded my game and now im getting so may failed to download things 🥹


[1/25/2026 5:02 PM] chaptermaster_kaelveydran
I'm pretty sure Fallout Anomaly does a sort of downgrade on it's own, Did you do the downgrade manually?


[1/25/2026 5:02 PM] londonnnb
yeah i did


[1/25/2026 5:02 PM] londonnnb
ts is so confusing its like running into a billion problems


[1/25/2026 5:03 PM] chaptermaster_kaelveydran
That's probably the reason why lol, Change it back to next gen then run the installer


[1/25/2026 5:03 PM] londonnnb
now i have to figure out how to do that </3


[1/25/2026 5:03 PM] chaptermaster_kaelveydran
Let me do some checking


[1/25/2026 5:04 PM] chaptermaster_kaelveydran
"To reset or revert a downgraded Fallout 4 (e.g., from v1.10.163 back to Anniversary Edition), the most reliable method is to perform a clean reinstall via Steam to remove modified files. Alternatively, run a "re-updater" if you used a patcher, or manually replace files with the latest version"


[1/25/2026 5:04 PM] londonnnb
ill redownload


[1/25/2026 5:04 PM] londonnnb
since itll take like 10 mins


[1/25/2026 5:05 PM] chaptermaster_kaelveydran
Good to hear, Just let Fallout Anomaly deal with any downgrades lol


[1/25/2026 5:05 PM] londonnnb

[1/25/2026 5:45 PM] shaggyrogers0420
so quick question, do you need to wear a gas mask at all times or just during storms?


[1/25/2026 5:46 PM] jackson21a
I always wear it so im unsure,


[1/25/2026 5:46 PM] shaggyrogers0420
how do you have enough filters though?


[1/25/2026 5:46 PM] shaggyrogers0420
im still learning stuff like rad management and healing so its all rather confusing to me


[1/25/2026 5:46 PM] dylan17082
storms and high radiation areas


[1/25/2026 5:48 PM] perinthia
is there a command to force your character out of power armor? i seem to have a glitch where my armor has duplicated itself and i can no longer leave it


[1/25/2026 5:49 PM] shaggyrogers0420
you could try the command to remove a npc on yourself idk if itll work though. 


cf "actor.switchtopowerarmor" none

Hey so ive recenntly returned to this discord but now i cant access some channels. I cant find a roles cahnnel either. Is there something im missing?


[1/25/2026 5:54 PM] perinthia
that sounds like it may be a discord issue, not an issue with this specific channel


[1/25/2026 5:55 PM] perinthia
does tesla armor cause NPC's to turn agressive? ik it says it only damages enemies but i think it may be damaging all NPC's


[1/25/2026 6:01 PM] throt124
Damn. I was hoping to see like a keybind channel or something. Any way to wipe my gas mask? ITs got blood all over it and i cant see anything


[1/25/2026 6:02 PM] perinthia
yeah there is a keybind, i think its like alt or shit + K


[1/25/2026 6:02 PM] perinthia
i just rebound mine to K


[1/25/2026 6:03 PM] perinthia
its in the MCM for the gas mask, under survival


[1/25/2026 6:05 PM] throt124

when the player icon has a yellow limb and a piece of armor is marked yellow on that icon, what does that actually mean? I checked status and didn't have anything going on, except adrenaline


[1/25/2026 6:40 PM] mr.azai
prolly just pain, use some ibuprofen


[1/25/2026 6:40 PM] mr.azai

You may not have a high enough combination of skills.


[1/25/2026 7:22 PM] jackson21a
Actually you may get that perk automatically with a high enough skill level. Unsure which one but perhaps science.

I'm using the controller with the controller support enabled but I can't use the pipboy at all but can jump but if I change to mouse and keyboard I'm able to use the pipboy but can't jump, I'm not sure if this is an known Anomaly issue or something on my end


[1/25/2026 7:23 PM] dallas9911
Need more point in the skill that relates to that perk most perks are gained by lvling the skills correlating to that skill


[1/25/2026 7:24 PM] dylan17082
seen this yesterday and it worked for meyeah click this link in your browser and apply this preset in steam input - steam://controllerconfig/377160/3482465058
go to this path in your falloutanomaly directory - FalloutAnomaly\mods\Fallout Anomaly Master Files\F4SE - and delete CustomControlMap.txt
disable the controller support mod and load fallout anomaly. navigate the menu to enable your controller ingame then go to the customise controls screen and reset everything to default
hopefully that fixes everything for you

@Chapter Master Kael Veydran


[1/25/2026 7:24 PM] chaptermaster_kaelveydran
Thanks mate


[1/25/2026 7:24 PM] dylan17082
NP


[1/25/2026 7:29 PM] chaptermaster_kaelveydran
Where's the customize controls screen? you mean in the settings of the game or the mcm?


[1/25/2026 7:30 PM] dylan17082
in like the settings when ur loaded into the game


[1/25/2026 7:30 PM] dylan17082
the key bindings page in the normal game settings


[1/25/2026 7:31 PM] chaptermaster_kaelveydran
There's no option for opening the pipboy on controller


[1/25/2026 7:32 PM] dylan17082
did you delete the custom controlet map file


[1/25/2026 7:32 PM] dylan17082
mines didnt work till that was gone. and disable the controler support mod


[1/25/2026 7:34 PM] chaptermaster_kaelveydran
I did both yeah, Let me try again


[1/25/2026 7:40 PM] londonnnb
how long is the download normally?


[1/25/2026 7:42 PM] chaptermaster_kaelveydran
Depends on if you set your stuff up on an SSD and have good Internet, It could take a couple days or hours, It all just depends on certain variables


[1/25/2026 7:47 PM] perinthia
so apparently if an NPC either  initiates a convo with you or give you a legendary item while your using a workbench, it soft crashes the game since since it freezes you in place and does not let you close what ever invisible menu popped up, and you cant do anything except reload your last save


[1/25/2026 7:49 PM] perinthia
i was using a weapons workbench when deacon gave me the deliverer and due to that the menus overlapped and wouldn't let me close one of them since it didnt actually even appear, forcing me to reload a previous save


[1/25/2026 7:49 PM] kazifca
hey


[1/25/2026 7:49 PM] kazifca
try teleporting to yourself


[1/25/2026 7:49 PM] kazifca
I am curious tbh


[1/25/2026 7:49 PM] kazifca
player.moveto player


[1/25/2026 7:50 PM] chaptermaster_kaelveydran
That might cause a blackhole Kaz :LMAO:


[1/25/2026 7:57 PM] dylan17082
where do i get power armour training. Ive got my T60 from the BHOS but cant use it yet


[1/25/2026 7:58 PM] perinthia
il try that the next time it happens and see if that fixes things, i had already reloaded by the time i sent that


[1/25/2026 7:59 PM] perinthia
you should get it when the brotherhood knights you after clearing fort strong


[1/25/2026 7:59 PM] perinthia
orr no there is a knight in the room that trains you my bad, i dont remember his name


[1/25/2026 7:59 PM] perinthia
but he is in the room with the 4 sets of power armor in the prydwyn


[1/25/2026 8:00 PM] dylan17082
found him. thankyou


[1/25/2026 8:01 PM] perinthia
also note to self, do not try to scrap weapons to make more inventory space, i ended up scrapping 4 weapons and gained 200 lbs of junk from it all lol


[1/25/2026 8:01 PM] perinthia
idk how like 50 lbs of weapons turn into 200 lbs of junk, but il take it when im actually in my settlement lol


[1/25/2026 8:09 PM] chaptermaster_kaelveydran
You're my hero dude, Resetting them to default made the pipboy option appear


[1/25/2026 8:16 PM] shaggyrogers0420
whats the max level in this pack? Trying to plan out a character and kinda need to know how many perks to expect


[1/25/2026 8:48 PM] perinthia
as far as i know,  level 65,535 is the max, which is the max in default fallout 4


[1/25/2026 8:48 PM] shaggyrogers0420
ok so there isnt a max inforced by the pack is more what I was asking lol


[1/25/2026 8:48 PM] perinthia
ah yeah i dont believe there is lol


[1/25/2026 8:50 PM] londonnnb
i have like a gb per second internet


[1/25/2026 8:50 PM] chaptermaster_kaelveydran
I think that'll be enough


[1/25/2026 8:50 PM] londonnnb
okok


[1/25/2026 8:51 PM] chaptermaster_kaelveydran
Do you know how to fix the issue where you're only able to check a small part of the map in the pipboy? It's like stuck in the top left corner in a small box, I think it's a resolution issue


[1/25/2026 8:52 PM] perinthia
where can i find the hellfire X-03 power armor?


[1/25/2026 9:05 PM] shaggyrogers0420
so if I want the crosshair dot on when im not aiming and off when I am aiming what setting do I use? I tried to mess with immersive hud but I cant get it right


[1/25/2026 9:06 PM] shaggyrogers0420
if im not mistaken on what mod it is, its on a gunner boss in the south


[1/25/2026 9:08 PM] krimlin
Can I ask here for a little help with installing the modpack? I'm a bit on the dumb side of things tonight it seems and the written guide doesn't list my issue.


[1/25/2026 9:10 PM] nomad5157
What's up


[1/25/2026 9:16 PM] krimlin
I may be a complete idiot here but I can get to the final percentage of the installation for FA. It fails at the end listing a bunch of what looks like base fallout 4 files being unable to be downloaded from DLCs and the like.

I'm launching the game after a fresh install to get all those files first but even that doesn't seem to help.


[1/25/2026 9:18 PM] shaggyrogers0420
this might sound dumb but it was the issue for me. Do you have enough room on your drive?


[1/25/2026 9:19 PM] krimlin
Sure do!


[1/25/2026 9:22 PM] krimlin
Unless 400gb isn't enough space.


[1/25/2026 9:23 PM] shaggyrogers0420
with game stuff I belive it is over 400gb


[1/25/2026 9:23 PM] shaggyrogers0420
dont quote me though im not for sure


[1/25/2026 9:24 PM] perinthia
you have to downgrade the game


[1/25/2026 9:24 PM] krimlin
Oooooh. I thought wabbajack did that itself theses days. My mistake then.


[1/25/2026 9:24 PM] perinthia
it used to, but the most recent patch for fallout 4 broke that, so it has to be done manually


[1/25/2026 9:25 PM] krimlin
Then that'd be my issue most likely.


[1/25/2026 9:25 PM] kazifca
No, I'm pretty sure it was discussed recently that the downgrader is working


[1/25/2026 9:25 PM] shaggyrogers0420
are you sure? Cause I dont ever downgrade my game wabbajack does it for me


[1/25/2026 9:25 PM] kazifca
Start with the most recent version, no CC pack though


[1/25/2026 9:25 PM] perinthia
ah, i downloaded it about a month ago and it wasnt working, so if it was fixed since then nvm


[1/25/2026 9:25 PM] kazifca
I got told the other day too dw


[1/25/2026 9:25 PM] shaggyrogers0420
lets put it this way I downloaded anomaly tonight and im in game so it does it now


[1/25/2026 9:26 PM] kazifca
corrected*


[1/25/2026 9:27 PM] krimlin
hmmmm...


[1/25/2026 9:28 PM] perinthia
its quite depressing when i download a new power armor mod, and when i finally get the power armor its worse than the base X-01 power armor set


[1/25/2026 9:29 PM] kazifca
❤️ power armor is unbalanced on a fundamental level to begin with due to accessibility


[1/25/2026 9:30 PM] krimlin
It wouldn't be an issue for my Fallout 4 install to be on a different drive, would it?


[1/25/2026 9:30 PM] kazifca
Which makes it difficult to balance as a mod, make sure you get any missing patches tho that might help


[1/25/2026 9:31 PM] perinthia
true lol, I wanted to try the Hellcat power armor mod out, but it has like half the stats of the X-02 armor lol (although the X-02 could just be over tuned)


[1/25/2026 9:31 PM] kazifca
Just keep your installs of anomaly, mo2, and fallout on the same drive iirc


[1/25/2026 9:31 PM] kazifca
External probably not reco, nor HDD


[1/25/2026 9:32 PM] kazifca
Mods are generally speaking balanced against the vanilla game & doesn't account for mod packs


[1/25/2026 9:33 PM] krimlin
It's an internal and an ssd so all good there.


[1/25/2026 9:33 PM] kazifca
and wabbajack on the same drive?


[1/25/2026 9:33 PM] kazifca
yeah I would assume


[1/25/2026 9:33 PM] krimlin
That... was indeed my issue. Wabbajack wanted my fallout 4 install on the same drive.


[1/25/2026 9:33 PM] krimlin
Sorry for bugging you all over a silly mistake like that


[1/25/2026 9:33 PM] kazifca
Naw it's all good, worse has been done


[1/25/2026 9:44 PM] shaggyrogers0420
how do I access aft settings? I dont see it in mcm and I dont have a holotape for it


[1/25/2026 9:45 PM] kazifca
I honestly couldn't tell you G, I just play with dog


[1/25/2026 9:46 PM] chaptermaster_kaelveydran
For me the AFT master control is in the medicine category in the AID spot


[1/25/2026 9:46 PM] shaggyrogers0420
you are a patron saint and I love you!


[1/25/2026 9:46 PM] shaggyrogers0420
that is exactly what I was looking for!


[1/25/2026 9:47 PM] chaptermaster_kaelveydran
Hah no worries mate


[1/25/2026 9:47 PM] chaptermaster_kaelveydran
I don't know why it's in the medicine category lol


[1/25/2026 9:49 PM] chaptermaster_kaelveydran
Is anyone else having the issue where the local pipboy map is locked to a lower resolution? I don't know how to fix it


[1/25/2026 9:52 PM] shaggyrogers0420
I think that is a base game issue


[1/25/2026 9:54 PM] chaptermaster_kaelveydran
I've looked around and it seems to be related to UI mods, specifically FallUI in this case


[1/25/2026 9:54 PM] shaggyrogers0420
welp im not against being wrong then lol


[1/25/2026 9:54 PM] chaptermaster_kaelveydran
xD


[1/25/2026 9:54 PM] chaptermaster_kaelveydran
It's either UI related or something to do with the controller (which makes no sense)


[1/25/2026 9:58 PM] shaggyrogers0420
controllers do tend to make computer get mad.

On another note, is there something bound to Q and if not is there a reason vafs isnt? Debating moving it from G just wanted to make sure before I did


[1/25/2026 9:58 PM] chaptermaster_kaelveydran
G is default for vafs, I set mine to space bar


[1/25/2026 10:02 PM] shaggyrogers0420
what is your jump?


[1/25/2026 10:10 PM] x4vi6r
are high level gunners supposed to be taking multiple 308's to the dome? i get their armor is strong but i feel like there's something wrong with my damage settings


[1/25/2026 10:13 PM] rushedtempo
Makes the game so much better


[1/25/2026 10:18 PM] shaggyrogers0420
is anyone able to help me with fall hud? I want to set up the dot crosshair but I can not figure these settings out


[1/25/2026 10:22 PM] aceisbased.
is there any way to make "backup" permanent saves?


[1/25/2026 10:24 PM] shaggyrogers0420
do you mean have multiple permanent saves, if so just hit new save, it saves it to a new slot.


[1/25/2026 10:28 PM] aceisbased.
Where would i find the option to create a new save?


[1/25/2026 10:30 PM] chaptermaster_kaelveydran
I'm using controller so jump on keyboard doesn't affect me


[1/25/2026 10:38 PM] londonnnb
how do i open the mod?


[1/25/2026 10:39 PM] chaptermaster_kaelveydran
Which mod are you looking for wock?


[1/25/2026 10:39 PM] londonnnb
yes how do i open anomaly


[1/25/2026 10:39 PM] chaptermaster_kaelveydran
You mean the game itself?


[1/25/2026 10:39 PM] londonnnb
yes


[1/25/2026 10:39 PM] chaptermaster_kaelveydran
Has everything been installed and set up properly?


[1/25/2026 10:39 PM] londonnnb
yes


[1/25/2026 10:39 PM] londonnnb
it just finished installing


[1/25/2026 10:40 PM] chaptermaster_kaelveydran
Go to your folder where you had it installed then go to mod organizer, Then click on launch Fallout Anomaly


[1/25/2026 10:41 PM] londonnnb
okok


[1/25/2026 10:41 PM] chaptermaster_kaelveydran
There's a youtube video called (OFFICIAL) Fallout Anomaly Installation Guide, That'll help you further


[1/25/2026 10:49 PM] londonnnb
what do i do if it opens only as a background precess


[1/25/2026 10:50 PM] chaptermaster_kaelveydran
Just let it load, It just needs to register everything


[1/25/2026 10:59 PM] perinthia
the Wh-mk.22 might be my favorite weapon that i just found


[1/25/2026 10:59 PM] nomad5157
Sorry guys will fix the bot deleting links soon. It’s still a wip


[1/25/2026 11:18 PM] shaggyrogers0420
anyone else keep seeing random sparks on the ground? Ive seen it in to different interiors now


[1/25/2026 11:26 PM] londonnnb
whats keybind to load the preset?


[1/25/2026 11:27 PM] londonnnb
oh nvm


[1/25/2026 11:27 PM] chaptermaster_kaelveydran
lol


[1/25/2026 11:29 PM] aceisbased.
Where would i find the option to create a new save?


[1/26/2026 12:17 AM] caughtmedead
Does bastion work for anyone else? I am getting damaged through my power armor for some reason


[1/26/2026 12:18 AM] shaggyrogers0420
bastion doesnt stop dmg from getting through. Some guns and ammo have pen %


[1/26/2026 12:19 AM] caughtmedead
Shouldn't it stop melee 100%?


[1/26/2026 12:19 AM] shaggyrogers0420
weapons and ammo have pen chance


[1/26/2026 12:20 AM] caughtmedead
Right guy, im talking about dogs biting mr through the 2 inch steel plate on my legs


[1/26/2026 12:20 AM] caughtmedead
xD


[1/26/2026 12:20 AM] shaggyrogers0420
ok you didnt say dogs lol but dogs attacks are still "weapons" according to the game and likely still have a armor pen %


[1/26/2026 12:26 AM] darklary
shotguns are crazy good at penning. Or, the armor I'm wearing isn't registering as armor properly, and thus is penned by everything.


[1/26/2026 1:47 AM] shaggyrogers0420
are you just getting one tapped?


[1/26/2026 1:47 AM] darklary
usually, but sometimes just halved when already hurt.


[1/26/2026 1:58 AM] shaggyrogers0420
its possible its not your armor per say but more specifically your helmet. Shot gun rounds might be penning your helmet and in my experience so far that means instant death


[1/26/2026 1:58 AM] shaggyrogers0420
in other news I entered the kingdergarden in concord and a kid whispered at me so now I need a friend lol


[1/26/2026 4:28 AM] mosiitwakipa
So.. I'm downloading Anomaly for the first time and got errors a few times now after installation this most recent time saying to manually download a few missing mod packs. I did then zipped them to the mod folder and clicked "Retry" on Wabbajack.. if there is an error I have to reinstall it all over again every time? The process takes a while so maybe there's a better way to do this or?


[1/26/2026 4:30 AM] mosiitwakipa
I guess I don't see why it would need too if I already have most if not all of the mods already in my D: Fallout Anomly Downloads folder?


[1/26/2026 5:50 AM] rud87
is it just me or best crafting station and your headquarters are the underground tunnels  ?


[1/26/2026 5:50 AM] rud87
SInce it's basically available everywhere on map


[1/26/2026 7:03 AM] rud87
Is it not possible to avoid PA at all


[1/26/2026 7:36 AM] perinthia
The new fallout update didn't break the modlist I assume?


[1/26/2026 8:41 AM] iluvchudstv
how do i disable DOF?


[1/26/2026 8:50 AM] limpan7
how do I disable these random ambient sounds? sounds like someone is talking or some shit


[1/26/2026 9:49 AM] theazelotus
Yeah dude I was perfectly fine and then a pale mutant hound ran up to me and one shot me


[1/26/2026 9:53 AM] .droozie
Just sending some kudos out there for an amazing modlist. I’ve cleared the entire Northwest of the map and am thoroughly enjoying the game play. Well done and thank you it has scratched my survivalist itch. 🙏


[1/26/2026 10:07 AM] darklary
See I'd considered that, and turned lethal headshots off for players. It's just raw damage through armor.


[1/26/2026 10:20 AM] rud87
Saving the game has quickly turned into a frustration with no added challenge tbh


[1/26/2026 10:31 AM] darklary
How do you mean? Low on smokes?


[1/26/2026 10:33 AM] notsamko
Dumb question, is it easy for me to add additional weapons, I like the selection in the mod Im just a nut and like the idea of having as much of that content as possible. Will damage values and levelled list things be super messed up?


[1/26/2026 10:35 AM] rud87
No I've plenty but it just doesn't make any sense going into pip-boy light one like I get it's to make it immersive but afaik it makes it worse than just hitting F5.


[1/26/2026 10:36 AM] izaslon
how can i get rid of fallevil without crashing theyre so out of place


[1/26/2026 10:42 AM] darklary
the radial menu can also be used to smoke one. And, I am fairly certain you could hotkey smokes so you don't even have to open the pipboy.


[1/26/2026 10:42 AM] rud87
again it's just doesn't click for me


[1/26/2026 10:42 AM] rud87
even the animation isn't smoking it's a fake stimpak


[1/26/2026 10:44 AM] rud87
they are not under the radial menu either


[1/26/2026 10:44 AM] darklary
are they not for you? I have them in mine, I am a version back from you.


[1/26/2026 10:44 AM] rud87
yeah radial menu sucks in general


[1/26/2026 10:44 AM] rud87
no purified water etc


[1/26/2026 10:46 AM] rud87
is there way to get back the old favorites menu alongside with the radial ?


[1/26/2026 10:52 AM] darklary
Let me check on that


[1/26/2026 11:07 AM] caughtmedead
If you put your gun away and use the radial menu it will play the animation, if you have something in your hands it won’t play it


[1/26/2026 11:08 AM] rud87
It's always unholstered and animation has always been there


[1/26/2026 11:08 AM] rud87
it only did a smoking animation the first time I've ever smoked one and then it's always stimpak animation and that's not even the case here


[1/26/2026 11:13 AM] darklary
I'm sorry to say, I'm not seeing the classic favorites menu.


[1/26/2026 11:15 AM] x4vi6r
whats yall ap at? mine glitched and at 1098, trying to set it back to normal


[1/26/2026 11:28 AM] naggoob
Does anyone else have issues with the Gunners at the bridge area close to Drumlins Diner? Wel, not the gunners but the bridge part, and it flickering in and out of existence


[1/26/2026 11:29 AM] darklary
Yup, seen that. At least it's solid, but I still hate it.


[1/26/2026 11:29 AM] darklary
at level 77 with 6+4 agility I have 149


[1/26/2026 11:37 AM] izaslon
amyone able to delete fallevil


[1/26/2026 12:06 PM] rud87
afaik the game is not balanced. Ive high endurance and full stack gear with extra health from skills but some random raider alone in the woods near sanctuary one shots me.


[1/26/2026 12:07 PM] rud87
That should never be the case in these circumstances, this ain't Frost.


[1/26/2026 12:08 PM] rud87
I also went back to kill him only to find out I was killed by a .38 caliber


[1/26/2026 12:08 PM] rud87
Anyway


[1/26/2026 12:33 PM] sickb0y_
hello everyone


[1/26/2026 12:33 PM] sickb0y_
hope you're all doing ok


[1/26/2026 12:34 PM] sickb0y_
i have a little issue, can't open MCM in-game :/ it crashes every single time


[1/26/2026 12:34 PM] sickb0y_
i know it's loading all the mod configs and its heavy, but it's crashing every time so i can't apply the anomaly profile


[1/26/2026 12:35 PM] rud87
the first time it takes quite bit of a time


[1/26/2026 12:35 PM] rud87
especially scourge takes long


[1/26/2026 12:36 PM] sickb0y_
i understand


[1/26/2026 12:36 PM] rud87
just load up a new game


[1/26/2026 12:37 PM] rud87
grab your pip boy, open up mcm click on the first section to start loading and leave it


[1/26/2026 12:37 PM] canadiandesert
Hey not too sure from the announcements but is Fallout 4 Anomaly working again or is it still broken?


[1/26/2026 12:37 PM] sickb0y_
will try that thanks


[1/26/2026 12:37 PM] rud87
it works


[1/26/2026 12:38 PM] canadiandesert
Nice Ill give it another go then


[1/26/2026 1:01 PM] sickb0y_
still crashing


[1/26/2026 1:01 PM] sickb0y_
every single time :/


[1/26/2026 1:01 PM] sickb0y_
is there a way around this by any chance ?


[1/26/2026 1:02 PM] rud87
then you've issues with your loadorder or setup


[1/26/2026 1:02 PM] sickb0y_
like applying the MCM profile via file editing ?


[1/26/2026 1:02 PM] rud87
i've reinstalled the list from scratch numerous times and never had any issue with mcm loading up


[1/26/2026 1:05 PM] darklary
It might be time to ask about pc specs. Whatchu got under the hood?

I got good hardware. it's something that's making MCM  halt the entire fallout 4 process


[1/26/2026 1:10 PM] sickb0y_
it may be the proton version that i'm using. (opted for proton-cachyos since the installer recomended it)


[1/26/2026 1:10 PM] darklary
and you're drivers are up to date?


[1/26/2026 1:10 PM] sickb0y_
yeah


[1/26/2026 1:10 PM] darklary
hmmmm


[1/26/2026 1:10 PM] sickb0y_
this mod (MCM Booster - SCOURGE Cache tweak) was suposed to fix my issue


[1/26/2026 1:11 PM] sickb0y_
i read online that  scourge it's what makes it freeze


[1/26/2026 1:11 PM] sickb0y_
i think at some point MCM reaches a mod that it can't handle (conflict or corruption), so it crashes


[1/26/2026 1:12 PM] nimshi89
General QWuestion people, can this mod run on a steamdeck?


[1/26/2026 1:12 PM] darklary
On a steamdeck? I can't imagine it would work too well, no. Probably will not.


[1/26/2026 1:12 PM] sickb0y_

[1/26/2026 1:13 PM] darklary
If it's a corrupted mod, then your best bet is to...idk clean reinstall? Unless you have the patience to go through each and every mod to see which one is broken. OR, know enough about the actual code side of this to figure out which and re-acquire it.


[1/26/2026 1:14 PM] darklary
Also, did you activate any of the optionals?


[1/26/2026 1:14 PM] darklary
you mentioned the mcm booster. Scourge.


[1/26/2026 1:15 PM] darklary
I guess try with that off?


[1/26/2026 1:15 PM] sickb0y_
can't send screenshots here


[1/26/2026 1:16 PM] sickb0y_
but i have on my console:


[1/26/2026 1:16 PM] darklary
you set up the page file, right?


[1/26/2026 1:16 PM] sickb0y_
[BOS] Conflicts found, check po3_baseobjectswapper.log in %PATH% for more info


[1/26/2026 1:17 PM] sickb0y_
isn't that just for people with low RAM ?


[1/26/2026 1:17 PM] darklary
I have 64 gigs of ddr5 and I still made sure to do that. It has (Seemingly, anyway) helped with stability.


[1/26/2026 1:18 PM] sickb0y_
controller support , nvidia reflex support , all the grab skills + dog can grab player


[1/26/2026 1:18 PM] sickb0y_
tried = crash


[1/26/2026 1:18 PM] darklary
you are the second person I've encountered who activated controller support and is now having issues.


[1/26/2026 1:19 PM] darklary
Course, the other guy I know personally and I gotta say...He's the reason I'm not convinced curses don't exist.


[1/26/2026 1:19 PM] darklary
Because every single mod pack or overhaul he's EVER tried to play, I have watched him myself set things up correctly, and it still breaks.

i have a monster of a computer and still can't play skyrim


[1/26/2026 1:20 PM] darklary
I am pretty sure that if you and I both did a fresh, clean, modless install of fallout 4


[1/26/2026 1:20 PM] darklary
somehow, we would have differences in our games.


[1/26/2026 1:21 PM] darklary
THis is gonna sound crazy, but try without controller support?


[1/26/2026 1:22 PM] sickb0y_
i'm gonna try


[1/26/2026 1:22 PM] sickb0y_
right now


[1/26/2026 1:23 PM] sickb0y_
it may or may not be related to the page file since i skipped that part


[1/26/2026 1:23 PM] sickb0y_
i have enough ram


[1/26/2026 1:24 PM] rud87
All I can say is disabling every support such as reflex control and everything related to ENB have increased my performance and stability so much so that I forgot how it looked like before


[1/26/2026 1:24 PM] rud87
Gunplay is crucial for me because I play the game as a shooter and not primarily as a RPG


[1/26/2026 1:25 PM] rud87
sounds dumb but that's why I need more frames


[1/26/2026 1:25 PM] sickb0y_
relatable


[1/26/2026 1:25 PM] rud87
also I suggest Frame generation mod


[1/26/2026 1:26 PM] rud87
It doesn't matter how many frames you got, not every frame provide smooth gameplay


[1/26/2026 1:26 PM] rud87
it's just a F4se plugin harmless to include into modlist


[1/26/2026 1:26 PM] rud87
no loadorder required it's just a plugin


[1/26/2026 1:29 PM] caughtmedead
How is the input latency? When I tried frame gen on Stalker 2 it was unplayable, felt like my inputs were delayed by a whole second lol


[1/26/2026 1:29 PM] rud87
because stalker is an unoptimized garbage

{Reactions}
💯

[1/26/2026 1:30 PM] rud87
frame gen input latency tied to the minimum stable fps your setup can maintain


[1/26/2026 1:30 PM] rud87
Better the base game performance lower the input lag


[1/26/2026 1:30 PM] darklary
That's it. I'm gonna play kenshi.

{Reactions}
😂 ❤️

[1/26/2026 1:31 PM] rud87
A stable 60 will provide you the feeling of a 90 with frame gen


[1/26/2026 1:31 PM] sickb0y_
stalker 2 is just too heavy for us mere mortals


[1/26/2026 1:31 PM] rud87
but slapping frame gen or lossless scaling onto 30 fps brings heavy delay


[1/26/2026 1:31 PM] rud87
I just learned these by testing both

check this out


[1/26/2026 1:32 PM] rud87
Use upscaling mod paired with frame generation and remove everything enb


[1/26/2026 1:33 PM] rud87
If you told me that I'd refund the stalker 2 after 20 minutes i wouldn't believe you


[1/26/2026 1:33 PM] rud87
but that game is worse than how f4 was first released


[1/26/2026 1:33 PM] caughtmedead
Oh god…. F4 release …


[1/26/2026 1:33 PM] sickb0y_
yeah it's an unfinished game


[1/26/2026 1:33 PM] rud87
well the gameplay also sucks


[1/26/2026 1:34 PM] rud87
not mentioning the story lol


[1/26/2026 1:34 PM] sickb0y_
no spoilers plssss


[1/26/2026 1:34 PM] rud87
it's like cursing the bad wizards game

[1/26/2026 1:34 PM] sickb0y_
thank you


[1/26/2026 1:34 PM] rud87
the spoiler is it's not STALKER game


[1/26/2026 1:34 PM] sickb0y_
the video i've sent is about the old engine though


[1/26/2026 1:34 PM] sickb0y_
x-ray and it's forks


[1/26/2026 1:35 PM] nimshi89
thanks mate


[1/26/2026 1:35 PM] caughtmedead
The reason gamma is so good and stable now is because of all those engine level tweaks from the monolith engine, wish we could get something like that for f4 😂


[1/26/2026 1:35 PM] rud87
nah I'll just wait for modders to sort stuff out


[1/26/2026 1:36 PM] rud87
I'd rather play ANYTHING than to spoil it with a wannabe STALKER installment


[1/26/2026 1:36 PM] rud87
anyone using Underground tunnels for their base of operations ? And if so any suggestions for inventory management ?


[1/26/2026 1:37 PM] sickb0y_

I’m having an issue after reinstalling the mod pack, where my game in borderless isn’t maximizing and it has 2 half inch black bars on each sides of my monitor.


[1/26/2026 1:39 PM] likutyr
Look how they massacred my lore...


[1/26/2026 1:39 PM] bitablack69
I’ve tried using Bethini to fix as well


[1/26/2026 1:39 PM] sickb0y_
edit .ini file maybe ?


[1/26/2026 1:39 PM] likutyr
You need to use Bethini while MO2 is running


[1/26/2026 1:40 PM] rud87
the only reason Im so into this modlist and f4 modding ingeneral is that I've played Stalker in the first release back in the day


[1/26/2026 1:40 PM] rud87
It was so immersive and weird and different


[1/26/2026 1:40 PM] bitablack69
oh I haven’t tried that, always thought you were supposed to run it while MO2 is closed


[1/26/2026 1:40 PM] rud87
I had to take sick days for college


[1/26/2026 1:41 PM] rud87
And I have refunded the second game in like first a couple minutes


[1/26/2026 1:42 PM] likutyr
Put about 80 hours into S2 before the save corrupted. 

It has the spirit and means to be a good Stalker game, just needs some love(unreal engine update)


[1/26/2026 1:43 PM] sickb0y_
MCM still crashing after changing proton versions


[1/26/2026 1:43 PM] likutyr
Also, does anyone know why Backyard Batteries crafting recipies don't show up in the chemical workbench?


[1/26/2026 1:43 PM] sickb0y_
funny enough


[1/26/2026 1:43 PM] sickb0y_
it crashes AFTER it loads all the scourge mods


[1/26/2026 1:43 PM] darklary
I think you'll need to make an electronics bench. Which is done with the engineering bench.


[1/26/2026 1:43 PM] rud87
nah it's chronically a stalker theme park rather than a stalker game


[1/26/2026 1:44 PM] rud87
also it spoils too much like ELI5 all the story bits


[1/26/2026 1:44 PM] darklary
would you say it's "like a resort"?


[1/26/2026 1:44 PM] rud87
there's no unknwon feeling like it was in the first game


[1/26/2026 1:44 PM] caughtmedead
It’s too bad most big companies now adays lean on unreal as a crutch, as shoddy as fallout is you can definitely appreciate the fact they took the time to write their own engine and modding kit extending off of it


[1/26/2026 1:44 PM] rud87
and like the anomalies feel like a chore to overcome / counter with mechanics rather than the actual wtf


[1/26/2026 1:45 PM] rud87
I dont know it just didnt click for me


[1/26/2026 1:45 PM] likutyr
I had over 3k 5.45x39 standard ammo in stash and a Dnipro that 2 shot headshot most stalkers before I did the fourth big main quest


[1/26/2026 1:48 PM] likutyr
I want to git gud in this modpack, but there's so much random stuff that can off you in moments...


[1/26/2026 1:49 PM] rud87
I dumped everything on medicine robustness and salvaging/gunsmith


[1/26/2026 1:50 PM] darklary
I tuned off lethal headshots on players. Been pretty fun ever since i did that. Don't worry I still get one shot a lot. Shotguns just seem to not be stopped by armor.


[1/26/2026 1:50 PM] rud87
how do you do that ?


[1/26/2026 1:50 PM] darklary
or rather, I think maybe it's not calculated by pellet. I know there's a % chance for things to pen, but I think if a shotgun pens, every pellet pens. And that usually results in more damage than you have health.


[1/26/2026 1:50 PM] likutyr
I went to Concord and rounded a corner straight into a Licker. Set me back like 30 minutes.


[1/26/2026 1:50 PM] rud87
even wearing Army helmet doesn't prevent that


[1/26/2026 1:51 PM] darklary
Go into the MCM, combat, MAIM, Headshots, turn them off for players.


[1/26/2026 1:51 PM] darklary
Cause yeah, i had around 400 armor at level 20 right? And a raider could punch me in the face with no brass knuckles, no nothin, and that was instant death.


[1/26/2026 1:51 PM] rud87
done


[1/26/2026 1:51 PM] darklary
So I said "Ok, I'm turning that off."


[1/26/2026 1:51 PM] rud87
nice


[1/26/2026 1:52 PM] rud87
dude .38 caliber low level raider 1 shotted me while Im like 350 armor with a helmet


[1/26/2026 1:52 PM] darklary
shoot unarmed super mutants are still one of the most dangerous enemies. Since that double fisted down smash seems to insta me even STILL at level 77 with 1500 armor.


[1/26/2026 1:53 PM] likutyr
Has anyone tried turning off the mod that disables healing on level up?


[1/26/2026 1:53 PM] darklary
nope.


[1/26/2026 1:54 PM] darklary
remember to horde legendaries people. You can scrap that at settlements for microchips and apply whatever the fuck legendary effects you wanted. Granted you need the perks to do so. But those are like...findable.


[1/26/2026 1:54 PM] darklary
Stack you some legendaries, balistic weaves, and do EVERY DRUG you find.

Hey friends, I was wondering which Mod is connected to the Weak Muscles effect?


[1/26/2026 1:55 PM] darklary

I feel like it's damn apocalypes but I'm not seeing anything that would indicate it is, in fact, what is responsible for weak muscles.


[1/26/2026 2:02 PM] aerocj
Yeah I've really been struggling with the mod, its kinda created a complete stop in my playthrough which is a bummer as I was having a blast


[1/26/2026 2:03 PM] aerocj
The periodic staggers seem to happen ever 10ish seconds and I feel like I tried to do everything to "fix" it


[1/26/2026 2:04 PM] darklary
Oh, it's based on radation levels. It's a form of rad sickness.


[1/26/2026 2:04 PM] darklary
two ways to fix. A doctor: with the clear my rads option. This costs 300 caps


[1/26/2026 2:04 PM] darklary
Way two: cleansing tonics


[1/26/2026 2:05 PM] darklary
Those are bought from doctors and can be carried around. Downside: like 800 or 900 a piece with low barter.


[1/26/2026 2:05 PM] aerocj
Yeah the issue is I'm stuck in Sanctuary, have no real way to access a doctor and I'm stumbling every 5 seconds trying to get anywhere, plus no traders are selling a cleansing tonic


[1/26/2026 2:05 PM] aerocj
So I feel like I'm softlocked rn


[1/26/2026 2:05 PM] darklary
Yeah that's really rough to have gotten THAT of all forms of rad sickness so early on. Have you been to covenant or diamond city before?


[1/26/2026 2:06 PM] darklary
you said "stuck" in sanctuary so I'm guessing not yet.


[1/26/2026 2:07 PM] rud87

[1/26/2026 2:10 PM] sickb0y_
might have to drop the modlist if it doesn't work :/


[1/26/2026 2:10 PM] rud87
it crashes before you click apply right ?


[1/26/2026 2:10 PM] sickb0y_
it loads some mods, when it gets to DLC - "Something" it crashes


[1/26/2026 2:10 PM] sickb0y_
after loading scourge


[1/26/2026 2:11 PM] sickb0y_
i don't even have time to apply the profile


[1/26/2026 2:11 PM] limon8525
Hey there, does this modpack require downgrading Fallout 4 to v1.10.980.0?


[1/26/2026 2:11 PM] darklary
WAbajack does that for ya


[1/26/2026 2:12 PM] limon8525
Thank god.  Appreciate the info.


[1/26/2026 2:14 PM] rud87
I couldnt find an individual ini


[1/26/2026 2:14 PM] rud87
but my best guess is MCM saves the profile individually for each mod


[1/26/2026 2:14 PM] rud87
and not in it's own ini


[1/26/2026 2:15 PM] rud87
BUT if you cant load those addonsthen they may not be effective whilst you play anyway


[1/26/2026 2:15 PM] rud87
have you tried deleting everything but anomaly download folder and reinstall from scratch  ?


[1/26/2026 2:15 PM] rud87
it only takes a few minutes


[1/26/2026 2:15 PM] sickb0y_

well mb not for the bsa archives but still


[1/26/2026 2:16 PM] sickb0y_

DLC Timing


[1/26/2026 2:17 PM] sickb0y_
immediately after it loads that mod


[1/26/2026 2:17 PM] rud87

If I were you I'd delete fallout 4 folder in the documents and everything inside fallout anomaly folder OTHER THAN DOWNLOADS


[1/26/2026 2:21 PM] rud87
and run wabbajack to reinstall


[1/26/2026 2:21 PM] sickb0y_
and being xx means that it's not loaded correctly or something

I tried that and even during daylight I strugle to see anything, I saw in the support forum a guy just used the stalker gasmask instead


[1/26/2026 3:51 PM] benjany
Ill probs do that


[1/26/2026 3:51 PM] rud87
you can simply remove the effect through mcm settings of the gas mask mod


[1/26/2026 3:51 PM] rud87
its not that big of a deal


[1/26/2026 3:51 PM] rud87
rn


[1/26/2026 3:52 PM] rud87
I always loved it tho


[1/26/2026 3:57 PM] benjany
Ive turned all the effects off and everything is dark


[1/26/2026 4:06 PM] darklary
it gets so dark in this game sometimes.


[1/26/2026 4:06 PM] darklary
I have a bright head lamp on my helmet.


[1/26/2026 4:06 PM] darklary
it may as well not exist.


[1/26/2026 4:08 PM] benjany
Yeah I get that but dont understand why the contrast just goes so far down when I put the thing on


[1/26/2026 4:09 PM] rud87
it shouldnt


[1/26/2026 4:10 PM] rud87
you may not have all of its fx disabled


[1/26/2026 4:10 PM] benjany

[1/26/2026 4:10 PM] rud87

Is the cigarette supposed to be animated as an injection? or is that a bug? lol


[1/26/2026 4:24 PM] shaggyrogers0420
I dont see the smoking animation mod in the line up so I think its either a unintended missing mod or just not something they are worrying about rn. But I dont think its a bug there just isnt a animation by base for smoking


[1/26/2026 4:29 PM] rud87
its a bug


[1/26/2026 4:56 PM] chaptermaster_kaelveydran
Ahh okay


[1/26/2026 5:09 PM] carmelfb
the collection is pretty promising, do you have any plans to tweak power armor in the future?
perhaps make it a rare resource and require the player to find parts to repair an exoskeleton before you can even use one?
then make it something that constantly requires maintenance?


[1/26/2026 5:16 PM] shaggyrogers0420
powerarmor is already made rare if im not mistaken. And changed drasticaly on how you obtain it


[1/26/2026 5:18 PM] aerocj
Silly question here, how do you salvage/breakdown junk for parts? I know its part of the skill I just don't know how to access the salvage menu


[1/26/2026 5:39 PM] londonnnb
is there any way to boost my fps?


[1/26/2026 5:56 PM] iluvchudstv

[1/26/2026 6:05 PM] rud87
end


[1/26/2026 6:07 PM] shaggyrogers0420
so anyone got a good way to get ammo? Im rather early game and having some serious ammo issues


[1/26/2026 6:11 PM] limon8525
Hey, so anyone else have weird issues where you mag dump 7 rounds directly into a bald raider's head with the .45 pistol and they ignore it like it's a minor inconvenience?


[1/26/2026 6:12 PM] limon8525
It's happening at concord near the start of the game and I'm a bit flabberghasted.  I don't remember that being a thing in this modpack.


[1/26/2026 6:12 PM] jackson21a
Scrounger is a absolute life saver even late game.


[1/26/2026 6:22 PM] chaptermaster_kaelveydran
Does anyone know how to fix this issue where having the controller plugged in causes the pipboy's local map to be stuck in a small box/resolution? I know it's related to having the controller but I forgot how to fix it xP


[1/26/2026 7:40 PM] drippysprite
how to repair the houses at sanctuary??? i have 207/200 steel, it says press enter to repair. nothing happens.


[1/26/2026 7:49 PM] iluvchudstv
is it normal for zombies to take 2-3 headshots to die with a pistol or is the damage mod cooked?


[1/26/2026 10:23 PM] aceisbased.
Does any one know where to navigate to make a permanent save rather than just the three temporary save slots in game?


[1/26/2026 11:11 PM] shaggyrogers0420
sitting in vc if anyone wants to chill


[1/26/2026 11:11 PM] shaggyrogers0420
permanent saves happen when you sleep


[1/26/2026 11:11 PM] shaggyrogers0420
that or when you exit to desktop


[1/26/2026 11:15 PM] aceisbased.
Is there a way for me to make a save that is outside of the three save slots that get deleted as you make new saves?


[1/26/2026 11:16 PM] shaggyrogers0420
I dont think so. Though from experience you shouldnt be running multple characters many mods will fuck up if you try
