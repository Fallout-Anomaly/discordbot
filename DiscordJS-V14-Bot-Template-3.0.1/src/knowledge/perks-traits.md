### FAQ
**Q: How do I open the menu?**
A: Use the **"You Are Exceptional"** holotape in your inventory or look for the hotkey bind (often `K` or configurable in MCM).

**Q: Why can't I pick a perk?**
A: Check if you meet the **Skill Requirement** (e.g., Medicine 75), not just the Level requirement.
