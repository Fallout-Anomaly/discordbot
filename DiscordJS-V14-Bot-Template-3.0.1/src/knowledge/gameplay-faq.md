# Gameplay FAQ

## How does the healing system work?
Anomaly uses a complex health and injury system.
- **IFAK**: Stops heavy bleed, removes crippled status, heals 1%/s (80s).
- **SP-1 Stimpak**: Gradual HP/AP regen, cures injuries.
- **SP-2 Stimpak**: 3%/s HP/Limb healing for 40s. **Requires weapon holstered.**
- **SAM Splint**: Sets crippled limbs to 1HP.
- **Note**: Sleeping does not automatically heal crippled parts in this modpack.

## How do I save my game?
Standard saving is restricted. To save:
- **Sleep**: at least 1 hour in a bed/couch.
- **Smoke**: Smoking a cigarette will save your game. 
  - **Tip**: Holster your weapon and use the cigarette from the **Radial Menu (H)** for the animation to play correctly.
- **Vault 111**: The first safe save spot is the chair by the security baton in the vault.

## How does the Radiation system work?
- Radiation is highly lethal, especially during storms.
- **Dual-Layered System**: 
    - **RAD (Tissue Damage)**: Environmental exposure that reduces max HP.
    - **IRA (Ingested Particles)**: From food, water, and weather. High IRA makes you more vulnerable to RADs.
- **Medicine**:
    - **Ca-DTPA Injector**: Replaces Radaway. Removes Rads and IRA. (No sprinting while active).
    - **Potassium Iodide**: Replaces Rad-X. +200 Rad resist.
    - **Cleansing Tonic**: Cures **Radiation Poisoning**.
    - **Alcohol**: Effectively lowers IRA levels.

## Butchering and Hunting
- To butcher animals for meat and hide, you need a **Knife** or **Blowtorch** in your inventory.

## Is there a Recommended Difficulty?
- The modpack is designed around **Survival** difficulty.

## Faction Training
- **Power Armor**: You cannot use Power Armor immediately. You must be trained by a faction that uses it (e.g., Brotherhood of Steel) through their questline.
