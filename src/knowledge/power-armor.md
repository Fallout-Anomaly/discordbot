# Power Armor Mechanics (Damn Apocalypse)

## Rarity & Availability
- **X-01 Power Armor**: There is **exactly one** set of X-01 plates in the entire game, split among 6 unmarked crashes (Commonwealth, Far Harbor, Nuka-World). It is a true prototype.
- **T-60 Power Armor**: Restricted to Brotherhood of Steel and Atom Cats. There is only **one** loose set of plates in a hidden, well-guarded location.
- **T-45 / T-51**: Can be found at PA vendors (Arturo, Teagan) or military boss trunks.

## Frames
- **Scarcity**: Operational frames are hard to find. Most world-spawn frames are disabled or require repair.
- **Repairing Frames**: Requires specific **Perks** and **Service Manuals**.
- **West-Tek Proprietary Screws**: A new component needed to repair military-grade plates. Found in military locations or unlocked via "Service Manual" magazines.

## Quest Changes
- **When Freedom Calls**: You do **NOT** keep the Power Armor from Concord. It is taken from you after the quest.
