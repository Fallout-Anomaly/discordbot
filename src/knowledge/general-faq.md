## Common Questions
### Where can I find the build generator?
We have an interactive build generator on our website: [Character Builder](https://fallout-anomaly.github.io/websitedev/pages/guide.html#ai-assistant)

### How do I report a player?
Use the slash command `/report @User Reason`. This will alert the staff team privately.


### Is there a new game plus?
No, Anomaly is designed as a fresh hardcore experience.

### Can I add my own mods?
**Not recommended**. Adding mods voids support in the Discord. If you must, ensure they are compatible with the existing complex systems (MAIM, SCOURGE, etc.).

### My game is crashing on startup!
- Check if you have the **Fallout 4 Next-Gen Update** on Steam (required).
- Ensure your **Page File** is set to at least 20GB.
- If using an **External Drive**, move the installation to an internal SSD.
- Verify you don't have "Weapon Debris" enabled in the launcher settings (NVIDIA crash).

### I'm stuck in the Vault elevator!
This is often a high FPS physics bug. Cap your FPS to 60 or use the `Load Accelerator` settings included.

### Why do I have black face bug?
- Did you load a save from a different modlist?
- Did you modify the load order?
- Try creating a new character to verify.

### How do I use the flashlight?
- Hold `Tab` (Pip-Boy key) to toggle the flashlight.
- Some helmets have built-in headlamps.
