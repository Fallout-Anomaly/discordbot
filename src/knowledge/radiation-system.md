# Radiation System Guide

## Overview
The radiation system in Fallout Anomaly is a dual-layered mechanic that makes the wasteland far more dangerous. It consists of two interconnected systems:

1. **RAD (Tissue Damage)**: Traditional radiation damage from environmental exposure.
2. **IRA (Ingested Radioactive Particles)**: Internal radiation accumulated from food, water, weather, and hazards.

## The Radiation Loop
Radiation exposure leads to a deadly feedback loop:
1. **Initial Exposure**: Environmental RADs or Hazards damage you.
2. **RAD Accumulation**: Reduces Max HP.
3. **IRA Increase**: RADs feed into IRA levels.
4. **Vulnerability**: High IRA makes you *more susceptible* to taking RAD damage, creating a spiral.

**Fatal Progression**: Untreated radiation will eventually kill you. Even leaving a radioactive zone doesn't stop the damage if you have high IRA.

## Medicine & Treatment
Different medicines treat different types of radiation. Using the wrong one (like RadAway) can be ineffective or harmful.

| Medicine | Effect | Treats |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cleansing Tonic** | Cures Radiation Poisoning | ✅ Poisoning |
| **Ca-DTPA Injector** | Removes RADs & IRA over 30s. Disables sprinting. Base: -25 RADs / -50 IRA. | ✅ RADs, ✅ IRA |
| **MutAway** | Heals RADs directly. | ✅ RADs, ❌ IRA |
| **Potassium Iodide** | +200 RAD Res, -0.5 RAD/s (300s). Replaces Rad-X. | 🛡️ RADs, 🛡️ IRA |
| **Pb-Jelly** | Increases RAD Resistance. | 🛡️ RADs, ❌ IRA |
| **Booze** | Alcohol lowers IRA levels over time. | ✅ IRA, ❌ RADs |
| **Antibiotics** | Cures infections from radiation. | ✅ Infections |
| **Sleep Aid** | Treats Insomnia. | ✅ Insomnia |
| **Anodyne** | Relieves fatigue. | ✅ Fatigue |
| **Anti-Parasitic** | Removes parasites. | ✅ Parasites |
| **Stimulants** | Counters lethargy. | ✅ Lethargy |
| **Energy Pills** | Mitigates weakness. | ✅ Weakness |

## Survival Tips
- **Pre-Medicate**: Take **Potassium Iodide** or **Pb-Jelly** *before* entering glowing sea or heavy rad zones.
- **Break the Loop**: If you have high IRA, drink **Alcohol** or use **Ca-DTPA**. Normal MutAway won't help enough.
- **Geiger Counter**: Listen to it. It warns of ambient particles (IRA risk) and direct radiation.
- **Hazmat Suits**: Essential for radiation storms. Without one, you will accumulate IRA rapidly.

## Advanced Mechanics
- **RadBoy System**: An automated notification system that warns you of:
    - Ambient radioactive particles (IRA risk).
    - Radiation Poisoning levels.
    - Dangerous IRA accumulation.
- **Weather Hazards**: Radiation comes with the weather. Functional Gas Masks, Hazmat Suits, or Power Helmets are *required* to resist IRA during storms.
- **Equipment Breakage**: Masks and Suits can break. Always carry spares or repair kits.
- **Fission vs Fusion**: Fission-powered devices (nukes, cars) explode differently than Fusion ones.
- **Raider's Digest**: A new magazine series that unlocks specific crafting recipes.
