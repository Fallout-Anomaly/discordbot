# System Information

## MAIM Medical System 🏥
MAIM is a hardcore medical overhaul. Combat is lethal, and injuries require specific treatments.

### **Medical Items**
| Item | Effect |
| :--- | :--- |
| **SP-1 Stimpak** | Gradual HP/AP regen. Cures NPC injuries. Poison Resist (180s). |
| **SP-2 Stimpak** | 3%/s HP & Limb healing (40s). **Most powerful heal** (Req. Weapon Holstered). |
| **Med-X** | Treats Pain, Shock, Contusion. Heals Head 1%/s. Addictive. |
| **Ibuprofen** | Heals Head/Limbs 0.5%/s (180s). Mildly addictive. |
| **Bandage** | Stops **Light Bleeds**. Heals limbs 1%/s. |
| **QuikClot** | Stops **Heavy Bleeds**. Prevents further bleeding. |
| **IFAK** | Stops Heavy Bleed, removes Crippled status, heals 1%/s. |
| **SAM Splint** | Sets crippled limbs to 1 HP. Downgrades Heavy Bleed. |
| **TXA Injector** | Stops Light Bleeds, reduces Heavy Bleeds, +300s Wound Protection. |

> **Pro Tip**: Use **TXA** and **Ibuprofen** *before* a fight to reduce bleed and pain chance! "Pre-medding" works just like in Tarkov.

### **Detailed Mechanics**
- **Bleeding**:
    - **Light Bleed**: Limb < 50%. Lasts 90s.
    - **Heavy Bleed**: Limb = 0% (Crippled). Lasts until fixed or 90s.
    - **Trails**: you leave blood trails on the floor.
- **Pain**:
    - **Arm Pain**: Slower Reload.
    - **Leg Pain**: Slower Movement & Jump.
    - **Torso Pain**: Slower AP Regen.
- **Shock**:
    - If you bleed to 0 HP, you enter **Shock** instead of dying immediately.
    - Cure Shock with **Med-X** or by healing HP above threshold.
    - If limbs reach 0 Health while in Shock -> **Death**.
- **Headshots**:
    - **Lethal** if unarmored.
    - **Helmets** protection depends on caliber and distance.
    - **Contusion**: Surviving a headshot causes blindness/ringing ears. Treat with **Med-X**.
- **NPC Effects**: NPCs bleed for 30s. Stimpaks heal NPC limbs instantly (game balance).

## Combat Overhaul ⚔️
- **True Damage**: Damage is determined by **Caliber** (e.g. 5.56 round), not weapon level.
    - *Example*: A pipe rifle and a combat rifle using .38 rounds deal similar damage.
- **Ranges**: Rifles have +100% range. Snipers have +300% range. Shotguns have tighter spread (+30% accuracy).
- **SCOURGE**: Enemies have randomized Health and Resistance. No more "Bullet Sponges", but some enemies will be naturally tougher.
- **Munitions**: Adds new lore-friendly ammo types to the game.

## Condition Boy (HUD Widget)
The widget on your screen shows your physical status:
- **Limb Integrity**: Color-coded health for each limb.
- **Helmet Status**: Shows if your head is armored. **Unarmored Headshots = Instant Death**.
- **Armor Plates**: Some vests interact with the plate system. Plates degrade as they take damage.

---

## You Are Exceptional (YAE)
Replaces the Perk Chart with a Skill System (Fallout New Vegas style).
- **Skills**: 26 total Skills (0-100).
- **Perks**: Unlocked by Skill Level (e.g., Heavy Gunner requires 50 **Artillery** skill).
- **Tags**: You choose 3 "Tag Skills" at character creation for a +25 bonus.
- **Traits**: optional traits at start (e.g., "Trigger Discipline").

---

## Loot & Scarcity (Damn Apocalypse)
- **Scarcity**: Stimpaks, Ammo, and Water are rare. You must scavenge.
- **Broken Items**: Found guns/armor may be "Broken". You need to repair them or strip them for parts.
- **Harvesting (HOTC)**: To get meat/leather from animals, you need a **Knife** or tool and must use the **Examine** key (`K`) on the corpse.
